[Patient]: Okay, so whats the next step for treatment?
[Doctor]: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.
[Patient]: How did the surgery go?
[Doctor]: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calots triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct ARHD was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calots triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.
[Patient]: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?
[Doctor]: Preoperative MRCP suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the ARHD, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.

[Doctor]: Hello, I received your medical records. Youre a 50-year-old African American female, and you presented with a three-week history of intractable headache, confusion, vertical binocular diplopia, photophobia, and difficulty with balance, correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats right. These symptoms have been bothering me for a while now.
[Doctor]: I see. During the examination, your best corrected visual acuities were 2025 in the right eye and 2020 in the left eye. Your intraocular pressures were 14 mmHg in both eyes, and no afferent pupillary defect was noted. Your extraocular motility and confrontational visual fields were full in both eyes. Is that correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats what they told me.
[Doctor]: The anterior segment examination in both eyes was unremarkable. However, the funduscopic examination revealed grade-four optic disc edema, blurring of the optic disc margin, and obscuration of vasculature of the optic nerve. Preretinal and intraretinal hemorrhages were present in both eyes, mainly in the peripapillary retina but also extending to the mid-peripheral retina. Are you following so far?
[Patient]: Yes, I understand.
[Doctor]: Optic nerve swelling was confirmed on optical coherence tomography OCT of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Fluorescein angiography revealed hyperfluorescence of the optic disc in both eyes. 
[Patient]: Okay, what does that mean for me?
[Doctor]: We also performed computed tomography of the head, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and magnetic resonance venography of the brain. These tests were unremarkable and showed no evidence of intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or ischemia.
[Patient]: Thats good news, right?
[Doctor]: Yes, its good that we didnt find any of those issues. Moving on to the cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis, it revealed an opening pressure of 30 cm H2O, 77 white blood cellsmm3 with 94 lymphocytes, 93 mgdL protein, and 73 mgdL glucose.

[Patient]: Yeah, doctor. Ive been having severe left back pain and left axillary numbness and paresthesia.
[Doctor]: I see. Based on your symptoms, we conducted some tests and found that the tumor has attached to the T2 and T3 vertebrae and infiltrated the corresponding nerve roots. This is likely the cause of your complaints. We consulted the neurosurgery and thoracic surgery services to discuss the best management for your condition.
[Patient]: What did they recommend, doctor?
[Doctor]: The magnetic resonance imaging MRI studies showed that there was no direct tumor invasion of the left brachial plexus or subclavian vessels. After discussing different treatment options, they recommended a posterior approach, image-guided T2 and T3 osteotomy followed by transthoracic en bloc resection of the thoracic tumor.
[Patient]: Will that help with the pain and numbness?
[Doctor]: Yes, the operation aims to address the issues caused by the tumor attachment and infiltration. Youll need to give your informed consent for the procedure.
[Patient]: Alright, I agree to the operation.
[Doctor]: Great. During the operation, well make an initial incision in the operating room and expose the spinal processes, lamina, and transverse processes from T1 through T5 as well as 5 cm of the ribs from the left costovertebral junction on the side of the tumor. Well then take images with the O-Arm and register your spine to the StealthStation navigation suite using a stereotactic probe.
[Patient]: What happens next?
[Doctor]: Well use spine navigation to place the instrumentation at the level above and below the tumor-infiltrated vertebrae. We wont place screws on the left T2 and T3 vertebrae. The spinous processes and lamina of T2 and T3 will be removed, and the nerve roots will be exposed on the left side.

"S: The patient is a 70-year-old woman who presented with chest distress lasting 11 hours, shortness of breath at rest, and difficulty lying in the recumbent position. She has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, for which she takes oral medications. She reports relief of initial symptoms post coronary angiography and stent implantation but developed hematochezia on the third day post-operation without abdominal pain.
O: Initial examination post-admission led to a diagnosis of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. Treatment included coronary angiography, stent implantation, and administration of heparin 2000 units arterial intrathecal and 3500 units intravenous. Post-procedure medications were aspirin 100 mgday, TiGraylo 90 mg every 12 hours, and enoxaparin sodium 0.4 mL every 12 hours subcutaneously for 3 days. On the third day post-operation, the patient developed hematochezia. Examination revealed mild abdominal tenderness in the left lower quadrant, peritoneal irritation signs, and a neoplasm-like mucous clot in the anus. Lab tests showed hemoglobin at 102 gL normal: 120-160 gL, prothrombin time 13.4 s normal: 11-13.5 s, and INR 1.2. Colonoscopy identified a submucosal mass in the sigmoid colon with a partially ruptured mucous membrane. Abdominal CT scan confirmed a submucosal hematoma in the sigmoid colon and thickening at the left flexure of the colon.
A: The primary diagnosis is coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, complicated by post-operative hematochezia likely due to anticoagulation therapy. Differential diagnosis includes gastrointestinal neoplasm versus hematoma secondary to anticoagulation. The prognosis depends on the management of the gastrointestinal complications and the underlying heart disease.
P: The initial management included discontinuation of anticoagulants, administration of total parenteral nutrition, and close monitoring. Given the lack of resolution of clinical symptoms with conservative treatment, further evaluation and possible intervention for the sigmoid colon issue are planned. Continued cardiovascular management with adjustments to anticoagulation therapy will be necessary, considering the gastrointestinal risks. Patient education regarding signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and the importance of follow-up appointments will be emphasized.

Your chest distress and shortness of breath had relieved. However, on the third day after the operation, you were diagnosed with hematochezia without abdominal pain.
[Patient]: Oh, I see.
[Doctor]: During the physical examination, we found mild abdominal tenderness, especially in your left lower quadrant, and some signs indicative of peritoneal irritation. There was also a neoplasm-like mucous clot connected to your bowel in the anus. We conducted some laboratory tests which showed declined levels of hemoglobin 102 gL, prolonged prothrombin time 13.4 s, and an international normalized ratio of 1.2.
[Patient]: What does that mean?
[Doctor]: These results indicate some issues with your blood clotting. Moving on, we performed a colonoscopy and found a submucosal mass in your sigmoid colon, covered with a partially ruptured mucous membrane and some clots in the cavity, causing obstruction. An abdominal CT scan showed a submucosal hematoma in the sigmoid colon, and the density of the mass did not significantly change on an enhanced CT scan. The left flexure of the colon was also thick, which could be another hematoma.

[Patient]: Yes, I came in with a strangulated large bowel and ventral hernia, 10 years after my LAGB procedure.
[Doctor]: Thats correct. At that time, you were still morbidly obese and had been lost to follow-up. We performed an emergency surgical hernia repair, which included resection of the necrotic transverse colon, and created a loop ileostomy. One year later, you presented with a LAGB port-site infection. Do you remember what we did during that time?
[Patient]: Yes, you removed the port and sutured the tubing to my abdominal wall.
[Doctor]: Exactly. During both admissions, we observed the LAGB tubing in a stable position adjacent to the transverse colon on the CT scans, with no concerns for penetration. Six months after the port-site infection, we elected to reverse the ileostomy. However, there were complications in the early post-operative period. Can you tell me about those symptoms?
[Patient]: I remember feeling really sick and ended up having abdominal sepsis.
[Doctor]: Yes, thats correct. The abdominal CT demonstrated transection of the remaining proximal transverse colon by the LAGB tubing. Due to this, we had to perform a right hemicolectomy, which involved the removal of the gastric band and tubing, and we created an end ileostomy. 
[Patient]: Oh, I see. So, whats the plan moving forward, doctor?
[Doctor]: Our main focus now is to ensure proper healing and monitor for any complications. Well keep a close eye on your progress and address any issues that may arise.

Doctor conducts the ultrasound examination
[Doctor]: The ultrasound examination revealed an exophytic hypoechoic mass that is connected to the medullary cavity through the interrupted bone cortex. There are no obvious blood signals or calcification in this area. Unfortunately, its difficult to characterize or classify the mass using traditional ultrasound methods.
[Patient]: Oh, I see. So, what does that mean for me, doctor?
[Doctor]: Based on the ultrasound findings, we can confirm that there is a mass located close to the bone. However, due to the limitations of the ultrasound, we cannot precisely determine the nature of the mass. We have included these findings in our ultrasound diagnostic report.
[Patient]: Hmm, so whats the next step?
[Doctor]: The next step would be a more detailed examination, such as an MRI or a biopsy, to better understand the nature of the mass and determine the appropriate treatment options.
[Patient]: Okay, when can we schedule that?
[Doctor]: Ill have my assistant schedule the MRI or biopsy for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, please monitor any changes in the mass or if you experience any discomfort or pain.
[Patient]: Alright, thank you, doctor.
[Doctor]: Youre welcome. Well be in touch with you to schedule the further examination. Please dont hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime.S: The patient is a 48-year-old woman who reports noticing a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of her left ring finger. She has a history of enchondroma in the same location.
O: Ultrasound examination revealed an exophytic hypoechoic mass in the distal phalanx of the left ring finger, connected to the medullary cavity through the interrupted bone cortex, with no obvious blood signals or calcification. The mass is difficult to characterize or classify using traditional ultrasound methods.
A: The ultrasound findings suggest the presence of a mass near the bone, but the nature of the mass cannot be precisely determined due to the limitations of the ultrasound. Further evaluation with MRI or biopsy is necessary to clarify the nature of the mass and determine appropriate treatment options.
P: Plan to schedule an MRI or biopsy as soon as possible to further evaluate the nature of the mass. The patient is advised to monitor any changes in the mass and report any discomfort or pain. Contact the clinic if any concerns arise.",8.5

[Patient]: Yes, thats fine.
Doctor performs the examination
[Doctor]: Your examination findings show that you have superficial and deep tenderness in your right lower abdominal quadrant when I palpate, and localized tenderness when I use percussion. Im going to order an abdominal ultrasound to get a clearer picture of whats going on.
Ultrasound results come in
[Doctor]: Your ultrasound results show findings consistent with acute complicated appendicitis. Because of this, we will start you on intravenous antimicrobial treatment, which includes cefotaxime and metronidazole. Well also need to take you to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy.
[Patient]: Oh, okay. What does the surgery involve?
[Doctor]: A laparoscopic appendectomy is a minimally invasive surgery to remove your inflamed appendix. Well make a few small incisions in your abdomen, insert a laparoscope to view the area, and then remove the appendix.
[Patient]: Will you test the fluid in my abdomen too?
[Doctor]: Yes, we will take a fluid culture during the surgery to identify any bacteria that may be present.
After the surgery
[Doctor]: The surgery went well, and we were able to remove your inflamed appendix. The fluid culture revealed the presence of P. aeruginosa, Str. viridans, and Gemella morbillorum bacteria. We will continue your antibiotic treatment to ensure a full recovery.

[Patient]: Hi, Doctor. Ive been having a fever, headache, and vomiting for about a month now.
[Doctor]: I see. We performed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI of your brain and it showed multiple varying sizes of ring-enhancing lesions scattered in both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. This suggests either a metastatic brain tumour or an infection. We also did a Computer Tomographic CT scan of your thorax and found a 6.5 cm x 4.5 cm mass in the right upper lobe, which is suspicious for primary lung malignancy.
[Patient]: Oh no, that sounds serious.
[Doctor]: Yes, we needed to investigate further. Your blood tests showed mild leucocytosis of 11.7 x 103uL and a normal C-reactive protein of 1.5 mgL. We also performed a lumbar puncture to check your cerebrospinal fluid CSF. It demonstrated raised intracranial pressure of 26 cm H2O, elevated cell count of 260 cellsmm3 with 90 lymphocyte predominance, low glucose of 1.9 mmolL, and raised protein at 1.15 gL.

[Patient]: I dont remember it clearly, but thats what my mom told me.
[Doctor]: Your mother also reported that youve had a decreased appetite recently and that youre usually a picky eater with a very limited diet. She said youve only eaten French fries since becoming sick. Shes been encouraging you to drink Gatorade and Pedialyte for hydration. Is that correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats true.
[Doctor]: Lets talk about your medical history. You have no significant past medical history, no surgeries or hospitalizations, and an allergy to amoxicillin that causes hives. You see a pediatrician regularly and are up to date on vaccines. You dont take any medications on a daily basis. Is that accurate?
[Patient]: Yes, thats all correct.
[Doctor]: Your family history indicates hypertension, but no family history of seizure disorders. You live in a house, and your mother says you feel safe at home. No one else in the home has been ill recently. Is that correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats right.
