"doctor: hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history?
patient: hi, i dont have any past medical history.
doctor: okay. what brings you in today?
patient: ive been experiencing painless blurry vision in my right eye for a week now. ive also had intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on my lower legs for the past 6 months.
doctor: thank you for sharing that. have you had any other symptoms such as neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, raynauds phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity?
patient: no, only an isolated episode of left knee swelling and testicular swelling in the past.
doctor: do you work with any toxic substances or have any habits like smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use?
patient: no, i work as a flooring installer and i dont have any toxic habits.
doctor: alright. we checked your vital signs and they were normal. during the physical exam, we found bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema in your right eye, which was greater than in your left eye. you also have a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect and a right afferent pupillary defect. your muscle strength and reflexes were normal, and your sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception was intact. we also noticed the maculopapular rash on your bilateral lower extremities.
patient: oh, i see.
doctor: your admitting labs showed some abnormal results. you have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 11.6 gmdl, hematocrit of 35.3, and mean corpuscular volume of 76.9 fl. you also have hyponatremia with a sodium level of 133 mmoll. your erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr is elevated at 33 mmhr, and your c-reactive protein crp is also elevated at 13.3 mgl. your urinalysis did not show any protein or blood.
patient: okay. what does that mean?
doctor: these results could indicate an underlying inflammatory or infectious process. we also performed a lumbar puncture, which showed clear and colorless fluid, 2 red blood cells per microliter, and 56 white blood cells per microliter.
patient: so, whats the next step?
doctor: we need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. well run additional tests and consult with a specialist to get a clearer understanding of your condition. in the meantime, well monitor your symptoms and provide supportive care. well keep you informed about any new findings and discuss the best course of treatment.

"doctor: hello, weve received your results from the ultrasound we performed in april 2017. it seems that there is a single thyroid nodule present in your left lobe, measuring 1 cm in its largest diameter. we also performed a complete biochemical screening, including tests for tsh, autoantibodies, and calcitonin.
patient: hmm, what did the screening results show, doctor?
doctor: your calcitonin level was found to be slightly elevated at 40 ngml, which is above the normal range of 1-4.8 ngml. to further investigate, we performed a stimulation test with intravenous calcium.
patient: and what did the stimulation test show?
doctor: after the stimulation, your calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ngml, which indicates that surgical treatment is necessary. as a result, you underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection on the side of the tumor.
patient: yes, i remember that. how was my recovery after the surgery?
doctor: your postoperative course was uneventful, with only a slight hypocalcemia recorded in the first day. however, it completely recovered 48 hours after the surgery, and you were discharged.
patient: thats good to hear. what did the tests on the removed tissue show?
doctor: immunohistochemistry performed on the thyroid nodule revealed the presence of a medullary thyroid cancer mtc measuring 1 cm. it is composed of cells with an eosinophilic cytoplasm and has a predominantly expansive growth pattern. a histological examination showed that the tumor cells were positive for calcitonin, cromogranin a, synaptofisin, and ttf-1, but negative for the presence of amyloid.
patient: what about the other surrounding tissue?
doctor: focal foci of c-cells hyperplasia were spread throughout the entire gland. however, none of the lymph nodes in the central compartment showed any signs of metastases.
patient: thats a relief. what other tests were done on the tissue?
doctor: to perform a more detailed analysis, we treated formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections with antigen retrieval using citrate buffer at high ph. they were then immunolabeled with a rabbit monoclonal anti-calcitonin antibody and incubated with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies.
patient: so, what does this all mean for my condition?
doctor: overall, these results confirm the presence of medullary thyroid cancer. fortunately, none of the lymph nodes showed signs of metastases, which is a positive sign. its important to continue with regular follow-up appointments and monitoring to ensure proper management of your condition.","s: the patient reported undergoing an ultrasound in april 2017, which identified a thyroid nodule in the left lobe. the patient underwent biochemical screening, including tsh, autoantibodies, and calcitonin levels, which showed elevated calcitonin. a stimulation test with intravenous calcium indicated significantly elevated calcitonin levels, leading to a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection. post-surgery, the patient experienced transient hypocalcemia but recovered within 48 hours. the patient inquired about the recovery and results of the tissue tests post-surgery.
o: ultrasound revealed a 1 cm thyroid nodule in the left lobe. initial calcitonin level was 40 ngml normal range 1-4.8 ngml. post-stimulation, calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ngml. postoperative recovery included slight hypocalcemia, resolving in 48 hours. immunohistochemistry of the thyroid nodule confirmed medullary thyroid cancer mtc, 1 cm in size, with cells positive for calcitonin, cromogranin a, synaptofisin, and ttf-1, and negative for amyloid. no lymph node metastases were found. additional tissue analysis involved antigen retrieval and immunolabeling confirming mtc.

"doctor: hello, can you tell me what brought you here today?
patient: hi, ive been having a progressive headache, nausea, and vomiting for about a week. i also noticed some right-side weakness, ptosis, and diplopia.
doctor: i see. lets talk about when you first presented with these symptoms. did you experience any conscious disturbance?
patient: yes, i had an acute onset conscious disturbance, and my glasgow coma scale was e3vam5 at the hospital.
doctor: okay, we performed a brain computed tomography and found an enhanced brain tumor with necrotic cystic changes. the tumor is located in your left temporal lobe with upward extension to the left basal ganglion and periventricular region, causing perifocal edema and midline shift.
patient: oh, that sounds serious.
doctor: yes, its a serious condition. we performed an emergent craniectomy for tumor removal in december 2006. the pathology revealed pleomorphic, hyperchromatic cells with glassy, astrocytic cytoplasm, as well as hypercellularity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis, consistent with the diagnosis of classic gbm.
patient: what happened after that?
doctor: you underwent radiotherapy a month later, followed by chemotherapy with temozolomide for six months. your performance status improved to a karnofsky grade of 70, and your clinical condition was stable thereafter.
patient: thats good to hear.

"doctor: hello, i understand that you have been dealing with hepatocellular carcinoma and had a liver transplantation from a living donor about a year ago. how have you been feeling recently?
patient: well, lately i developed some severe abdominal pain that has been really bothersome.
doctor: im sorry to hear that. it seems like you have developed severe acute pancreatitis. when you were admitted to the hospital, we started a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 gday to control your abdominal pain. over the course of 10 days, we increased the dose according to your pain intensity, reaching 2400 gday med 240 mgday. how has your pain been since then?
patient: its been a little bit better with the fentanyl, but its still quite painful.
doctor: i see. in addition to the fentanyl, we have also administered a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid to help alleviate the pancreatitis and your abdominal pain. we have gradually reduced the continuous fentanyl infusion, and it was discontinued after reaching 240 gday 10 of the maximum dose. however, you mentioned experiencing nauseavomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. is that correct?
patient: yes, thats right. it was pretty uncomfortable.
doctor: i apologize for the discomfort. to alleviate these symptoms, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion at 240 gday, and the symptoms disappeared. however, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced, so we decided to initiate a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. how has that been working for you?
patient: the patch has been helpful ive noticed a difference.
doctor: good to hear. unfortunately, your pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later. therefore, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion and titrated it to 600 gday. we have been gradually decreasing the dose daily 600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 gday. as your pancreatitis has improved, we were able to discontinue the fentanyl without causing withdrawal symptoms. the discontinuation was finally completed 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms. how are you feeling now?
patient: im feeling much better now, thank you.
doctor: thats great to hear. make sure to continue monitoring your symptoms and let us know if you experience any discomfort or changes in your condition. we will continue to follow up with you to ensure your recovery goes smoothly.","s: the patient, a post-liver transplant recipient, reports severe abdominal pain and has a history of hepatocellular carcinoma. recently diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis, the patient experienced some relief from pain with fentanyl infusion but still describes the pain as quite painful. symptoms of nausea, vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness were noted upon opioid discontinuation.
o: the patient was initially managed with a continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion, starting at 1200 gday and increased to 2400 gday based on pain intensity. following the discontinuation of fentanyl, withdrawal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness occurred. these symptoms resolved upon resuming fentanyl at 240 gday. a transdermal fentanyl patch was later used to taper the opioid more gradually. the patients pancreatitis recurred transiently, requiring resumption and gradual tapering of fentanyl infusion from 600 gday to 60 gday over several days. the patient reports feeling much better following the complete discontinuation of fentanyl, 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms.
a: the primary diagnosis is severe acute pancreatitis post-liver transplantation, complicated by opioid withdrawal symptoms following fentanyl discontinuation. the patients response to the reintroduction and gradual tapering of fentanyl suggests effective management of withdrawal symptoms.
p: continue monitoring the patients symptoms and recovery post-pancreatitis and post-fentanyl discontinuation. follow-up appointments should be scheduled regularly to assess pain levels, pancreatitis status, and any potential recurrence of symptoms. education on recognizing signs of pancreatitis and opioid withdrawal should be provided. referral to a pain management specialist and a gastroenterologist for ongoing pancreatitis management and to address any complications from liver transplantation may be necessary. ensure compliance with the prescribed pain management and withdrawal tapering protocols.","s: the patient, a male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma, reports severe abdominal pain that has been managed with a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 gday for approximately 10 days. he has experienced nausea, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. the patient has been treated with a transdermal fentanyl patch, which has been effective.
o: initial vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 120 mmhg, and abdominal pain of approximately 240 mgday. a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid were administered to alleviate the pancreatitis and the abdominal pain, and the symptoms recurred transiently one month later, leading to the discontinuation of the fentanyl infusion at 240 gday, which was discontinued after 12 hours. a follow-up with the patient was scheduled for one month post-discharge.
a: the primary diagnosis is severe acute pancreatitis with abdominal pain. differential diagnoses could include other causes of pancreatitis, but these were ruled out based on imaging and clinical presentation. the prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the patients response to the fentanyl.
p: continue regular follow-ups to monitor the patients condition and respond to any new symptoms or changes in symptomatology",6.5
"doctor: hello, how can i help you today?

patient: no, i am a non-smoker. i work as an engineer for a gas company.
doctor: alright. have you had any exposure to asbestos in your workplace?
patient: no, i dont think so.
doctor: lets perform a physical examination to check for any issues in your lungs. after examination i noticed a reduction of lung sounds at the right lung basis, but no clinical sign of autoimmune disease.
patient: hmm, what could be causing the chest pain then?
doctor: we will need to perform a chest x-ray cxr to investigate further. after cxr the results show a considerable reduction in the right lung volume with associated right pleural effusion.
patient: what does that mean?
doctor: it means there is fluid around your right lung. we should perform more tests to determine the cause. after tests all serological, autoimmune, and microbiological tests came back negative. lets do a computed tomography ct scan to get a better view. after ct the ct scan revealed a slight reduction in right lung volume with associated right pleural effusion and pleural thickening.
patient: whats the next step?
doctor: we will conduct a supplemental investigation to rule out any history of trauma, tuberculosis, and pneumothorax. we will also perform an echocardiography to exclude pulmonary hypertension, and a diaphragm dysfunction test through phrenic nerve stimulation. after investigations all tests were negative.
doctor: well proceed with a total body positron emission tomographycomputed tomography pet-ct to check for any abnormalities. after pet-ct there was a low-intensity hyper-accumulation of 18-fdg in the right pleura with increased concentration in the basal, middle, and posterior pleural surface.
patient: whats the next step, then?
doctor: well perform a surgical lung biopsy slb to identify the issue. after slb the biopsy identified non-specific fibrinous pleurisy, but the search for neoplastic or infectious cells was negative.
doctor: unfortunately, your forced vital capacity fvc has dropped significantly over the previous 3 years, and you have developed shortness of breath on exertion. i am going to prescribe a prednisolone course to help with the symptoms.

"doctor: hello, i heard you have a 6-month history of swelling in the left floor of your mouth, and you were referred to our institution. how can i help you today?
patient: yes, thats right. ive been experiencing some difficulty in swallowing, but i havent had any pain or tongue paralysis.
doctor: i see. lets perform an intraoral examination to better understand the issue. hmm, i can see a well-defined 3.5  3  2 cm-sized solid, spherical submucosal nodule adjacent to the sublingual gland. its covered with light bluish smooth mucus. do you feel any pain when i apply pressure to the tumor?
patient: yes, i feel slight pain when you press on it.
doctor: alright. your tongues mobility and sensory functions seem to be normal, and i dont detect any lymphadenopathy in the submandibular region on palpation. well need to conduct some laboratory tests and an enhanced computed tomography scan to get a clearer picture of the issue.
patient: okay, i understand.
after the tests
doctor: your lab results are all normal, and the enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a 2.8  1.8  2.1 cm-sized well-defined, solid, heterogeneous nodule that doesnt appear to involve the mandible. we also found a nodular lesion occupying the left floor of the mouth with abundant blood flow. no enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the submental or submandibular regions.
patient: so, what does that mean, doctor?
doctor: based on these findings, our initial clinical impression is that this could be a benign salivary gland tumor, dermoid cyst, or benign connective tissue neoplasm. we will need to schedule you for surgery via an intraoral approach to remove the tumor and further examine it.
patient: alright, so what will the surgery involve?
doctor: during the surgery, well make an elliptical incision around the periphery of the sublingual gland, and prepare a full-thickness tissue flap along the lingual aspect of the sublingual gland. after freeing the sublingual gland from its surrounding tissue, well find the well-circumscribed tumor without capsular extension beneath the body of the sublingual gland. well carefully free the submandibular gland duct and lingual nerve from the tumor surface, and completely excise the tumor along with the sublingual gland.
patient: i see. what happens after the surgery?
doctor: after the surgery, well fix the tissue sample with 10 formalin and submit it for histopathological diagnosis to determine the exact nature of the tumor.
patient: okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. im ready to proceed with the surgery and follow-up care.
doctor: youre welcome. well make sure to take good care of you during and after the surgery. if you have any questions or concerns, dont hesitate to reach out to us.","s: the patient reports a 6-month history of swelling in the left floor of the mouth, accompanied by difficulty swallowing. the patient denies experiencing pain or tongue paralysis. the patient feels slight pain upon palpation of the tumor.

patient: how did the surgery go?
doctor: due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in calots triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct arhd was excessively exposed. we used a fundus-first technique to confirm the arhd after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of calots triangle. we confirmed that the arhd drained into the cystic duct.
patient: was there any need to preserve the arhd?
doctor: preoperative mrcp suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the arhd, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.

"doctor: hello, i see that you are a 53-year-old woman with a posterior, stage iib nsclc in the left upper lobe. youve received neoadjuvant carboplatin, pemetrexed, and radiotherapy already. can you tell me if youve been experiencing any discomfort or new symptoms recently?
patient: yeah, doctor. ive been having severe left back pain and left axillary numbness and paresthesia.
doctor: i see. based on your symptoms, we conducted some tests and found that the tumor has attached to the t2 and t3 vertebrae and infiltrated the corresponding nerve roots. this is likely the cause of your complaints. we consulted the neurosurgery and thoracic surgery services to discuss the best management for your condition.
patient: what did they recommend, doctor?
doctor: the magnetic resonance imaging mri studies showed that there was no direct tumor invasion of the left brachial plexus or subclavian vessels. after discussing different treatment options, they recommended a posterior approach, image-guided t2 and t3 osteotomy followed by transthoracic en bloc resection of the thoracic tumor.
patient: will that help with the pain and numbness?
doctor: yes, the operation aims to address the issues caused by the tumor attachment and infiltration. youll need to give your informed consent for the procedure.
patient: alright, i agree to the operation.
doctor: great. during the operation, well make an initial incision in the operating room and expose the spinal processes, lamina, and transverse processes from t1 through t5 as well as 5 cm of the ribs from the left costovertebral junction on the side of the tumor. well then take images with the o-arm and register your spine to the stealthstation navigation suite using a stereotactic probe.
patient: what happens next?
doctor: well use spine navigation to place the instrumentation at the level above and below the tumor-infiltrated vertebrae. we wont place screws on the left t2 and t3 vertebrae. the spinous processes and lamina of t2 and t3 will be removed, and the nerve roots will be exposed on the left side.
patient: and then youll remove the tumor?
doctor: yes, during the resection, well notice an infiltration of the ganglia by the primary tumor that is in continuity with the ribs on the left side. well proceed with resection, tying the t2 and t3 nerve roots.

patient: hi, doctor. i am a 70-year-old woman and i was admitted to the cardiovascular department for chest distress for 11 hours. i have been experiencing shortness of breath at rest and difficulty laying in the recumbent position.
doctor: i see. have you had any prior medical conditions?
patient: yes, i was diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes mellitus a few years ago and have been taking oral medication for their treatment.
doctor: okay, let me explain what happened after your initial admission. after your clinical examination, you were diagnosed with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. you underwent coronary angiography and stent implantation, and during the operation, heparin was administered, which included an arterial intrathecal injection of 2000 units and an intravenous injection of 3500 units.
patient: alright.
doctor: after the angiography, we prescribed you aspirin 100 mg per day, tigraylo 90 mg once every 12 h, and enoxaparin sodium 0.4 ml once every 12 h subcutaneously for 3 days. your chest distress and shortness of breath had relieved. however, on the third day after the operation, you were diagnosed with hematochezia without abdominal pain.
patient: oh, i see.
doctor: during the physical examination, we found mild abdominal tenderness, especially in your left lower quadrant, and some signs indicative of peritoneal irritation. there was also a neoplasm-like mucous clot connected to your bowel in the anus. we conducted some laboratory tests which showed declined levels of hemoglobin 102 gl, prolonged prothrombin time 13.4 s, and an international normalized ratio of 1.2.
patient: what does that mean?
doctor: these results indicate some issues with your blood clotting. moving on, we performed a colonoscopy and found a submucosal mass in your sigmoid colon, covered with a partially ruptured mucous membrane and some clots in the cavity, causing obstruction. an abdominal ct scan showed a submucosal hematoma in the sigmoid colon, and the density of the mass did not significantly change on an enhanced ct scan. the left flexure of the colon was also thick, which could be another hematoma.
patient: so, whats the treatment for this?
doctor: we tried conservative treatment, which included stopping your anticoagulant medications, providing total parenteral nutrition, and monitoring your condition. however, your clinical symptoms did not resolve with this approach. we will continue to evaluate your condition and discuss further treatment options with you.

patient: yeah, my voice has been really hoarse, and ive had trouble swallowing too.
doctor: i understand. i also noticed in your past medical history that you had invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, which was er positive, pr negative, and her2 negative. you were treated with a mastectomy two years prior to this presentation. is that correct?
patient: yes, thats right.
doctor: during the clinical examination, we found paralysis of your right vocal cord. we also performed a ct scan of your neck, which revealed an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple bilateral thyroid nodules. have you experienced any other symptoms?
patient: no, not really. just the hoarseness and difficulty swallowing.
doctor: okay. we performed a fine needle aspiration fna of a right-sided 3.5 cm thyroid nodule, which was initially diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance, falling under bethesda category iii. we did a repeat fna three months later, and it yielded a diagnosis of benign follicular nodule, which is bethesda category ii. 
patient: i see.
doctor: due to your persistent hoarseness and compressive symptoms, as well as the atypical findings on the initial fna, we decided to proceed with a right thyroid lobectomy and a right vocal cord injection. intraoperatively, we observed that your right thyroid lobe was moderately enlarged with multiple nodules but no evidence of extrathyroidal extension.

"doctor: hello, how can i help you today?
patient: hi, doctor. im a 48-year-old woman and ive noticed a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of my left ring finger. i have a history of enchondroma in the same location.
doctor: i see. lets perform an ultrasound examination to get a better understanding of the mass.
doctor conducts the ultrasound examination
doctor: the ultrasound examination revealed an exophytic hypoechoic mass that is connected to the medullary cavity through the interrupted bone cortex. there are no obvious blood signals or calcification in this area. unfortunately, its difficult to characterize or classify the mass using traditional ultrasound methods.
patient: oh, i see. so, what does that mean for me, doctor?
doctor: based on the ultrasound findings, we can confirm that there is a mass located close to the bone. however, due to the limitations of the ultrasound, we cannot precisely determine the nature of the mass. we have included these findings in our ultrasound diagnostic report.
patient: hmm, so whats the next step?
doctor: the next step would be a more detailed examination, such as an mri or a biopsy, to better understand the nature of the mass and determine the appropriate treatment options.
patient: okay, when can we schedule that?
doctor: ill have my assistant schedule the mri or biopsy for you as soon as possible. in the meantime, please monitor any changes in the mass or if you experience any discomfort or pain.
patient: alright, thank you, doctor.
doctor: youre welcome. well be in touch with you to schedule the further examination. please dont hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime.","s: the patient is a 48-year-old woman who reports a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of her left ring finger. she has a history of enchondroma in the same location. she expresses concern about the nature of the mass and potential treatment options.
o: ultrasound examination of the left ring finger revealed an exophytic hypoechoic mass connected to the medullary cavity through an interrupted bone cortex. there were no blood signals or calcifications noted in the area. the mass could not be fully characterized or classified with ultrasound alone.
a: the primary assessment is a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of the left ring finger, with a differential diagnosis including recurrence of enchondroma or other benign bone tumors. the absence of blood signals and calcifications on ultrasound reduces the likelihood of a malignant process, but further diagnostic workup is necessary to rule out other possibilities.
p: plan to schedule an mri and possibly a biopsy to further evaluate the nature of the mass and to determine appropriate treatment options. the patient will be monitored for any changes in the mass or symptoms such as discomfort or pain. follow-up appointments will be arranged post-imaging and biopsy results to discuss treatment strategies. the patient is advised to contact the clinic if she has any concerns or new symptoms in the meantime.","s: the patient is a 48-year-old woman presenting with a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of the left ring finger. she has a history of enchondroma in the same location.

doctor: i see, any other symptoms youve been experiencing?
pt: yeah, ive also had these 30-second trance-like episodes during the day. my partner reported that sometimes i make repetitive swallowing movements, followed by disorientation and repetitive questioning. these episodes occur in clusters of up to seven per day.
doctor: are you aware of these episodes when they happen?
pt: well, im aware of some of them, but not all. i do have partial recollection of being unable to remember things during those times.
doctor: have you noticed any other changes in your memory?
pt: yes, ive noticed that i lose newly acquired memories over days, and i have difficulty recalling autobiographical events from my adulthood and familiar routes.
doctor: have you experienced any other symptoms along with these memory issues?
pt: ive developed olfactory hallucinations that smell like candy floss, which can last for up to a day and seem to happen independently of the amnestic episodes. i also feel like my sense of smell has become a bit blunted. plus, ive been having headaches with migrainous features, postural arm tremor, tingling in my legs, malaise, and low mood.
doctor: thank you for sharing that information. can you tell me about your medical history?
pt: my medical history is mostly unremarkable, but i did have symptoms of depression last year and a history of heavy alcohol use in the past.
doctor: based on your symptoms, we conducted several tests and investigations. your initial brain mri showed subtly increased t2 signal in the right hippocampus, even in the absence of any recent episodes. your eeg was normal, and the clinical examination revealed no focal neurological signs. we made an initial clinical diagnosis of tea.
doctor: we started treating you with lamotrigine, starting at 25 mg and gradually increasing it up to 100 mg twice a day. this resolved your trance-like and amnestic attacks. however, your other symptoms, such as headaches, tingling sensation in your limbs, and olfactory hallucinations, still persist.
pt: oh, okay. so whats the next step in my treatment plan?
doctor: since the lamotrigine has resolved your amnestic attacks, we will continue monitoring your progress and adjust the treatment as needed. we will also further investigate your other symptoms to find the best course of action. in the meantime, please keep track of your symptoms and report any changes to us.

doctor: immediately after endotracheal intubation, your systolic blood pressure increased from 130 to 145 mmhg, and your heart rate increased from 60 to 95 beats per minute bpm. two minutes later, your systolic blood pressure had decreased to 125 mmhg. propofol was continuously infused intravenously at a target concentration of 2 to 4 gml, and bis levels were maintained between 40 and 60.
patient: alright.
doctor: after an arterial catheter was placed, your position was changed from the supine to the right lateral position. surgery was then started.
patient: okay.
doctor: since no circulatory change associated with pain occurred during surgery, opioids were not administered. regarding hemodynamics, everything was stable throughout the procedure.
patient: thats good to hear.
doctor: yes, the surgery went well. please make sure to follow up with us for any post-operative concerns or further treatment. do you have any questions?
patient: no, i think you covered everything. thank you, doctor.
doctor: youre welcome. take care and have a smooth recovery","s: the patient is a 36-year-old female with a history of congenital insensitivity to pain with anhidrosis cipa, presenting for revision of left total hip arthroplasty. she reports recurrent episodes of unexplained fever, anhidrosis, burns, and bone fractures since birth. she actively manages her risk of hyperthermia through body surface cooling, maintaining her body temperature at approximately 36c. she has undergone multiple surgeries, including 7 for spinal deformity and bilateral total hip arthroplasty.
o: the patients weight is 50 kg, and height is 147 cm. recent surgical monitoring showed stable vital signs with a noted increase in systolic blood pressure from 130 to 145 mmhg and heart rate from 60 to 95 bpm immediately post-intubation, which later stabilized. hemoglobin level was mildly low at 10.6 gdl. no abnormalities were detected in chest radiographs and electrocardiograms. during surgery, no circulatory changes associated with pain were observed, and hemodynamics remained stable.
a: primary diagnosis is cipa with complications including recurrent bone fractures and requirement for multiple orthopedic surgeries. differential diagnosis should consider other neuropathies, but clinical history and presentation strongly support cipa. prognosis includes ongoing risk of injuries related to insensitivity to pain and temperature, necessitating continuous monitoring and preventive care.
p: post-operative management includes routine monitoring of vitals and recovery progress, with specific attention to signs of infection or mechanical issues with the hip prosthesis due to her condition. continue to manage anemia with appropriate nutritional support and possibly supplementation. educate on the importance of temperature regulation and injury prevention. schedule follow-up appointments for post-operative assessment and long-term management of cipa. no opioid analgesics are required due to her condition. referral to a geneticist for further evaluation and family planning advice is recommended.","s: the patient is a 36-year-old woman with a history of unexplained fever, anhidrosis, burns, and bone fractures, presenting with recurrent episodes of unexplained fevers, anhydrosis, and burns. she reports no signs of mental retardation or orthostatic hypotension. she has undergone 7 operations for spinal deformity and 1 total hip arthroplasty on both sides.
o: physical examination revealed a weight of 50 kg and a height of 147 cm. vital signs were within normal limits: systolic blood pressure at 130 mmhg, heart rate at 95 bpm, and oxygen saturation at 60 bpm. arterial catheter catheter was placed at the urinary bladder, esophagus, and precordial skin and controlled by a hot-air-type heater. blood biochemistry showed no abnormalities except mild anemia hemoglobin level of 10.6 gdl normal range: 10-15 gdl, hemoglobin at 10-20 gdl: 10 to 20 gdl. endotracheal intubation was performed at an effect-site concentration of 4 gml, and bis levels were maintained between 40 and 60. after muscle relaxation was achieved by the administration 50 mg of rocuronium",4.5
"doctor: hello, im dr. smith. can you please tell me what brought you to the emergency department today?
patient: hi, doctor. i had a seizure at home, and my mom called an ambulance. it was my first time having a seizure.
doctor: i see. you arrived about 15 minutes after the seizure, correct?
patient: yeah, thats right.
doctor: when you arrived, you were somnolent, arousable, and confused, which is consistent with a postictal state after a seizure. can you tell me if youve been feeling unwell recently?
patient: yeah, for the past two to three days, ive been feeling sick. i had upper respiratory infection symptoms, like cough and nasal congestion.
doctor: thank you for sharing that. your mother mentioned that she heard a thud and found you on the floor shaking and incontinent of your bladder and bowels. she said the shaking lasted about one to two minutes. can you confirm that?
patient: i dont remember it clearly, but thats what my mom told me.
doctor: your mother also reported that youve had a decreased appetite recently and that youre usually a picky eater with a very limited diet. she said youve only eaten french fries since becoming sick. shes been encouraging you to drink gatorade and pedialyte for hydration. is that correct?
patient: yes, thats true.
doctor: lets talk about your medical history. you have no significant past medical history, no surgeries or hospitalizations, and an allergy to amoxicillin that causes hives. you see a pediatrician regularly and are up to date on vaccines. you dont take any medications on a daily basis. is that accurate?
patient: yes, thats all correct.
doctor: your family history indicates hypertension, but no family history of seizure disorders. you live in a house, and your mother says you feel safe at home. no one else in the home has been ill recently. is that correct?
patient: yes, thats right.
doctor: when you arrived, we took your vital signs. your oral temperature was 38 celsius, heart rate 108 beats per minute, blood pressure 11170 millimeters of mercury, breathing rate 26 breaths per minute, and oxygenating at 97 on room air. on the initial physical exam, you appeared drowsy but overall well developed. we will continue to monitor you and run some tests to determine the cause of the seizure. in the meantime, please let me know if you experience any changes in your condition.
patient: okay, thank you, doctor.
doctor: youre welcome. i will be back to check on you and discuss the test results. if you have any questions or concerns, please dont hesitate to ask.
patient: thank you, i appreciate it.","s: the patient, a young individual with no significant past medical history, presented to the emergency department following a witnessed seizure at home, described by the patients mother as involving shaking and incontinence, lasting one to two minutes. the patient reported feeling unwell with symptoms of an upper respiratory infection, including cough and nasal congestion, for the past two to three days. the patient also noted a decreased appetite and a limited diet, primarily consisting of french fries, with efforts to maintain hydration through gatorade and pedialyte. the patient has an allergy to amoxicillin, which causes hives, and there is a family history of hypertension but no known seizure disorders.
o: upon arrival, the patient was somnolent, arousable, and confused, indicative of a postictal state. vital signs were recorded as follows: temperature 38c, heart rate 108 bpm, blood pressure 11170 mmhg, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation at 97 on room air. the initial physical examination showed the patient to be drowsy but well-developed.
a: the primary assessment is a first-time seizure, likely related to an acute illness, possibly the reported upper respiratory infection or a related fever. differential diagnoses could include an underlying neurological disorder or metabolic imbalance. the prognosis depends on further diagnostic results and response to initial management.
p: the management plan includes continued monitoring of vital signs and mental status, hydration, and nutritional support. laboratory tests and possibly neuroimaging will be conducted to investigate the cause of the seizure. education will be provided to the patient and family about seizure precautions and the importance of a balanced diet. a referral to a neurologist will be considered based on test results. the patient will be observed for any further seizures or deterioration in condition, with instructions given to alert medical staff immediately should symptoms change.","s: the patient, with a history of hypertension and a family history of seizures, presents with a chief complaint of upper respiratory infection symptoms, cough and nasal congestion. the patient denies any significant past medical history, no surgeries or hospitalizations, and an allergy to amoxicillin that causes hives.
o: upon examination, the patient was somnolent, arousable, and confused, consistent with a postictal state post-seizure. vital signs were recorded at 38 celsius, heart rate 108 bpm, blood pressure 11170 mmhg, respiratory rate 26 breaths per minute, and oxygenating 97 on room air. physical examination revealed a drowsy but overall well-developed child with no significant medical history.
a: the primary diagnosis is hypertension, likely secondary to a seizure. differential diagnoses could include other causes of hypertension, but these are less likely given the patients medical history and family history. the prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the lack of significant past seizures.
