"doctor: hello, can you please tell me about your past medical history?
patient: hi, i dont have any past medical history.
doctor: okay. what brings you in today?
patient: ive been experiencing painless blurry vision in my right eye for a week now. ive also had intermittent fevers, headache, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on my lower legs for the past 6 months.
doctor: thank you for sharing that. have you had any other symptoms such as neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, raynauds phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity?
patient: no, only an isolated episode of left knee swelling and testicular swelling in the past.
doctor: do you work with any toxic substances or have any habits like smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use?
patient: no, i work as a flooring installer and i dont have any toxic habits.
doctor: alright. we checked your vital signs and they were normal. during the physical exam, we found bilateral papilledema and optic nerve erythema in your right eye, which was greater than in your left eye. you also have a right inferior nasal quadrant visual field defect and a right afferent pupillary defect. your muscle strength and reflexes were normal, and your sensation to light touch, pinprick, vibration, and proprioception was intact. we also noticed the maculopapular rash on your bilateral lower extremities.
patient: oh, i see.
doctor: your admitting labs showed some abnormal results. you have microcytic anemia with a hemoglobin of 11.6 gmdl, hematocrit of 35.3, and mean corpuscular volume of 76.9 fl. you also have hyponatremia with a sodium level of 133 mmoll. your erythrocyte sedimentation rate esr is elevated at 33 mmhr, and your c-reactive protein crp is also elevated at 13.3 mgl. your urinalysis did not show any protein or blood.
patient: okay. what does that mean?
doctor: these results could indicate an underlying inflammatory or infectious process. we also performed a lumbar puncture, which showed clear and colorless fluid, 2 red blood cells per microliter, and 56 white blood cells per microliter.
patient: so, whats the next step?
doctor: we need to investigate further to determine the cause of your symptoms. well run additional tests and consult with a specialist to get a clearer understanding of your condition. in the meantime, well monitor your symptoms and provide supportive care. well keep you informed about any new findings and discuss the best course of treatment.
patient: alright, thank you, doctor.","s: the patient, a flooring installer with no significant past medical history, presents with painless blurry vision in the right eye for one week, intermittent fevers, headaches, body aches, and a nonpruritic maculopapular rash on the lower legs for six months. the patient also reports an isolated episode of left knee and testicular swelling in the past but denies any neck stiffness, nausea, vomiting, raynauds phenomenon, oral ulcerations, chest pain, shortness of breath, abdominal pain, or photosensitivity. no history of exposure to toxic substances or habits related to smoking, drinking, or illicit drug use.

"doctor: hello, weve received your results from the ultrasound we performed in april 2017. it seems that there is a single thyroid nodule present in your left lobe, measuring 1 cm in its largest diameter. we also performed a complete biochemical screening, including tests for tsh, autoantibodies, and calcitonin.
patient: hmm, what did the screening results show, doctor?
doctor: your calcitonin level was found to be slightly elevated at 40 ngml, which is above the normal range of 1-4.8 ngml. to further investigate, we performed a stimulation test with intravenous calcium.
patient: and what did the stimulation test show?
doctor: after the stimulation, your calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ngml, which indicates that surgical treatment is necessary. as a result, you underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection on the side of the tumor.
patient: yes, i remember that. how was my recovery after the surgery?
doctor: your postoperative course was uneventful, with only a slight hypocalcemia recorded in the first day. however, it completely recovered 48 hours after the surgery, and you were discharged.
patient: thats good to hear. what did the tests on the removed tissue show?
doctor: immunohistochemistry performed on the thyroid nodule revealed the presence of a medullary thyroid cancer mtc measuring 1 cm. it is composed of cells with an eosinophilic cytoplasm and has a predominantly expansive growth pattern. a histological examination showed that the tumor cells were positive for calcitonin, cromogranin a, synaptofisin, and ttf-1, but negative for the presence of amyloid.
patient: what about the other surrounding tissue?
doctor: focal foci of c-cells hyperplasia were spread throughout the entire gland. however, none of the lymph nodes in the central compartment showed any signs of metastases.
patient: thats a relief. what other tests were done on the tissue?
doctor: to perform a more detailed analysis, we treated formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections with antigen retrieval using citrate buffer at high ph. they were then immunolabeled with a rabbit monoclonal anti-calcitonin antibody and incubated with appropriate fluorescent secondary antibodies.
patient: so, what does this all mean for my condition?
doctor: overall, these results confirm the presence of medullary thyroid cancer. fortunately, none of the lymph nodes showed signs of metastases, which is a positive sign. its important to continue with regular follow-up appointments and monitoring to ensure proper management of your condition.","s: the patient reported undergoing an ultrasound in april 2017, which identified a thyroid nodule in the left lobe. the patient underwent biochemical screening, including tsh, autoantibodies, and calcitonin levels, which showed elevated calcitonin. a stimulation test with intravenous calcium indicated significantly elevated calcitonin levels, leading to a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection. post-surgery, the patient experienced transient hypocalcemia but recovered within 48 hours. the patient inquired about the recovery and results of the tissue tests post-surgery.
o: ultrasound revealed a 1 cm thyroid nodule in the left lobe. initial calcitonin level was 40 ngml normal range 1-4.8 ngml. post-stimulation, calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ngml. postoperative recovery included slight hypocalcemia, resolving in 48 hours. immunohistochemistry of the thyroid nodule confirmed medullary thyroid cancer mtc, 1 cm in size, with cells positive for calcitonin, cromogranin a, synaptofisin, and ttf-1, and negative for amyloid. no lymph node metastases were found. additional tissue analysis involved antigen retrieval and immunolabeling confirming mtc.
a: the primary diagnosis is medullary thyroid cancer, confirmed by histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the thyroid nodule and absence of metastasis in lymph nodes. the patients elevated calcitonin levels and the results of the stimulation test supported the need for surgical intervention, which was successfully performed without complications.
p: the patient will continue with regular follow-up appointments to monitor for any recurrence or progression of medullary thyroid cancer. monitoring will include periodic calcitonin levels and ultrasound imaging of the neck. the patient will be educated on the signs of recurrence and the importance of adherence to follow-up schedules. further genetic counseling may be considered to evaluate for familial mtc.","s: the patient, a male with a history of medullary thyroid cancer mtc diagnosed in april 2017, presented with a chief complaint of hypocalcemia following a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection.

"doctor: hello, can you tell me what brought you here today?
patient: hi, ive been having a progressive headache, nausea, and vomiting for about a week. i also noticed some right-side weakness, ptosis, and diplopia.
doctor: i see. lets talk about when you first presented with these symptoms. did you experience any conscious disturbance?
patient: yes, i had an acute onset conscious disturbance, and my glasgow coma scale was e3vam5 at the hospital.
doctor: okay, we performed a brain computed tomography and found an enhanced brain tumor with necrotic cystic changes. the tumor is located in your left temporal lobe with upward extension to the left basal ganglion and periventricular region, causing perifocal edema and midline shift.
patient: oh, that sounds serious.
doctor: yes, its a serious condition. we performed an emergent craniectomy for tumor removal in december 2006. the pathology revealed pleomorphic, hyperchromatic cells with glassy, astrocytic cytoplasm, as well as hypercellularity, microvascular proliferation, and necrosis, consistent with the diagnosis of classic gbm.
patient: what happened after that?
doctor: you underwent radiotherapy a month later, followed by chemotherapy with temozolomide for six months. your performance status improved to a karnofsky grade of 70, and your clinical condition was stable thereafter.
patient: thats good to hear.
doctor: however, a follow-up brain magnetic resonance imaging mri in june 2014 revealed a new enhanced nodular lesion, about 1.1 cm in diameter, at your left temporal base. the brain mri in october 2014 showed a progressive change in lesions, with a maximum of 3.0 cm in diameter.
patient: what did you do about that?
doctor: we performed another surgery for gross tumor removal. histologically, the tumors showed the oligodendroglial component. neoplastic cells also showed isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 idh1 positivity, diffuse p53 positivity, and o6-methylguanine-dna methyltransferase mgmt negativity as revealed by immunostaining.
patient: hmm, i see.
doctor: during your follow-up, we noticed signs of increased intracranial pressure in may 2015. as a result, you received a third debulking surgery.
patient: what did the third pathology reveal?
doctor: the third pathology revealed both gbm- and pnet-like components. in immunohistochemistry, the pnet-like component exhibited positivity for synaptophysin and cd56 and focal weak positivity for glial fibrillary.
patient: whats the next step for my treatment?
doctor: we will continue to monitor your condition closely and provide further treatment options as needed. its important to follow up with us regularly to ensure the best possible care.
patient: thank you, i appreciate your help.","s: the patient reports a progressive headache, nausea, vomiting, right-side weakness, ptosis, and diplopia for about a week. the patient also experienced an acute onset of conscious disturbance, with a glasgow coma scale score of e3vam5.
o: initial brain ct revealed an enhanced brain tumor in the left temporal lobe with necrotic cystic changes, upward extension to the left basal ganglion and periventricular region, causing perifocal edema and midline shift. post-operative pathology confirmed a diagnosis of glioblastoma multiforme gbm. follow-up mri in june 2014 showed a new 1.1 cm nodular lesion at the left temporal base, which progressed to 3.0 cm by october 2014. histology post-second surgery showed oligodendroglial components with idh1 positivity, diffuse p53 positivity, and mgmt negativity. the third surgery pathology revealed gbm- and pnet-like components with positivity for synaptophysin and cd56.
a: the primary diagnosis is recurrent glioblastoma multiforme gbm, with differential diagnosis including primitive neuroectodermal tumor pnet components. the prognosis is guarded due to the aggressive and recurrent nature of the tumor.
p: the plan includes close monitoring of the patients condition with regular follow-ups to assess for further progression or new symptoms. continued treatment options will be considered based on the evolution of the disease and the patients response to previous therapies. education on symptom management and potential side effects of treatments will be provided to ensure the patient remains informed about their care.","s: the patient reports progressive headache, nausea, and vomiting for about a week, accompanied by right-sided weakness, ptosis, and diplopia. the patient has a history of classic gbm diagnosed in december 2006.

"doctor: hello, i understand that you have been dealing with hepatocellular carcinoma and had a liver transplantation from a living donor about a year ago. how have you been feeling recently?
patient: well, lately i developed some severe abdominal pain that has been really bothersome.
doctor: im sorry to hear that. it seems like you have developed severe acute pancreatitis. when you were admitted to the hospital, we started a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 gday to control your abdominal pain. over the course of 10 days, we increased the dose according to your pain intensity, reaching 2400 gday med 240 mgday. how has your pain been since then?
patient: its been a little bit better with the fentanyl, but its still quite painful.
doctor: i see. in addition to the fentanyl, we have also administered a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid to help alleviate the pancreatitis and your abdominal pain. we have gradually reduced the continuous fentanyl infusion, and it was discontinued after reaching 240 gday 10 of the maximum dose. however, you mentioned experiencing nauseavomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. is that correct?
patient: yes, thats right. it was pretty uncomfortable.
doctor: i apologize for the discomfort. to alleviate these symptoms, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion at 240 gday, and the symptoms disappeared. however, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced, so we decided to initiate a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. how has that been working for you?
patient: the patch has been helpful ive noticed a difference.
doctor: good to hear. unfortunately, your pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later. therefore, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion and titrated it to 600 gday. we have been gradually decreasing the dose daily 600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 gday. as your pancreatitis has improved, we were able to discontinue the fentanyl without causing withdrawal symptoms. the discontinuation was finally completed 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms. how are you feeling now?
patient: im feeling much better now, thank you.
doctor: thats great to hear. make sure to continue monitoring your symptoms and let us know if you experience any discomfort or changes in your condition. we will continue to follow up with you to ensure your recovery goes smoothly.","s: the patient, a post-liver transplant recipient, reports severe abdominal pain and has a history of hepatocellular carcinoma. recently diagnosed with severe acute pancreatitis, the patient experienced some relief from pain with fentanyl infusion but still describes the pain as quite painful. symptoms of nausea, vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness were noted upon opioid discontinuation.
o: the patient was initially managed with a continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion, starting at 1200 gday and increased to 2400 gday based on pain intensity. following the discontinuation of fentanyl, withdrawal symptoms including nausea, vomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness occurred. these symptoms resolved upon resuming fentanyl at 240 gday. a transdermal fentanyl patch was later used to taper the opioid more gradually. the patients pancreatitis recurred transiently, requiring resumption and gradual tapering of fentanyl infusion from 600 gday to 60 gday over several days. the patient reports feeling much better following the complete discontinuation of fentanyl, 64 days after the onset of withdrawal symptoms.
a: the primary diagnosis is severe acute pancreatitis post-liver transplantation, complicated by opioid withdrawal symptoms following fentanyl discontinuation. the patients response to the reintroduction and gradual tapering of fentanyl suggests effective management of withdrawal symptoms.
p: continue monitoring the patients symptoms and recovery post-pancreatitis and post-fentanyl discontinuation. follow-up appointments should be scheduled regularly to assess pain levels, pancreatitis status, and any potential recurrence of symptoms. education on recognizing signs of pancreatitis and opioid withdrawal should be provided. referral to a pain management specialist and a gastroenterologist for ongoing pancreatitis management and to address any complications from liver transplantation may be necessary. ensure compliance with the prescribed pain management and withdrawal tapering protocols.","s: the patient, a male with a history of hepatocellular carcinoma, reports severe abdominal pain that has been managed with a continuous intravenous infusion of fentanyl at 1200 gday for approximately 10 days. he has experienced nausea, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. the patient has been treated with a transdermal fentanyl patch, which has been effective.
o: initial vital signs were stable with a blood pressure of 120 mmhg, and abdominal pain of approximately 240 mgday. a pancreatic enzyme inhibitor, antibiotic, and fluid were administered to alleviate the pancreatitis and the abdominal pain, and the symptoms recurred transiently one month later, leading to the discontinuation of the fentanyl infusion at 240 gday, which was discontinued after 12 hours. a follow-up with the patient was scheduled for one month post-discharge.
a: the primary diagnosis is severe acute pancreatitis with abdominal pain. differential diagnoses could include other causes of pancreatitis, but these were ruled out based on imaging and clinical presentation. the prognosis is cautiously optimistic given the patients response to the fentanyl.
p: continue regular follow-ups to monitor the patients condition and respond to any new symptoms or changes in symptomatology"
"doctor: hello, how can i help you today?
patient: hi, ive been experiencing some pain in my right chest lately.
doctor: i see. can you tell me more about your background? are you a smoker?
patient: no, i am a non-smoker. i work as an engineer for a gas company.
doctor: alright. have you had any exposure to asbestos in your workplace?
patient: no, i dont think so.
doctor: lets perform a physical examination to check for any issues in your lungs. after examination i noticed a reduction of lung sounds at the right lung basis, but no clinical sign of autoimmune disease.
patient: hmm, what could be causing the chest pain then?
doctor: we will need to perform a chest x-ray cxr to investigate further. after cxr the results show a considerable reduction in the right lung volume with associated right pleural effusion.
patient: what does that mean?
doctor: it means there is fluid around your right lung. we should perform more tests to determine the cause. after tests all serological, autoimmune, and microbiological tests came back negative. lets do a computed tomography ct scan to get a better view. after ct the ct scan revealed a slight reduction in right lung volume with associated right pleural effusion and pleural thickening.
patient: whats the next step?
doctor: we will conduct a supplemental investigation to rule out any history of trauma, tuberculosis, and pneumothorax. we will also perform an echocardiography to exclude pulmonary hypertension, and a diaphragm dysfunction test through phrenic nerve stimulation. after investigations all tests were negative.
doctor: well proceed with a total body positron emission tomographycomputed tomography pet-ct to check for any abnormalities. after pet-ct there was a low-intensity hyper-accumulation of 18-fdg in the right pleura with increased concentration in the basal, middle, and posterior pleural surface.
patient: whats the next step, then?
doctor: well perform a surgical lung biopsy slb to identify the issue. after slb the biopsy identified non-specific fibrinous pleurisy, but the search for neoplastic or infectious cells was negative.
doctor: unfortunately, your forced vital capacity fvc has dropped significantly over the previous 3 years, and you have developed shortness of breath on exertion. i am going to prescribe a prednisolone course to help with the symptoms.
patient: okay, thank you.
doctor: sadly, your condition has worsened with the onset of restrictive respiratory failure. its important to keep a close eye on your health and report any changes.

patient: yes, thats right. ive been experiencing some difficulty in swallowing, but i havent had any pain or tongue paralysis.
doctor: i see. lets perform an intraoral examination to better understand the issue. hmm, i can see a well-defined 3.5  3  2 cm-sized solid, spherical submucosal nodule adjacent to the sublingual gland. its covered with light bluish smooth mucus. do you feel any pain when i apply pressure to the tumor?
patient: yes, i feel slight pain when you press on it.
doctor: alright. your tongues mobility and sensory functions seem to be normal, and i dont detect any lymphadenopathy in the submandibular region on palpation. well need to conduct some laboratory tests and an enhanced computed tomography scan to get a clearer picture of the issue.
patient: okay, i understand.
after the tests
doctor: your lab results are all normal, and the enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a 2.8  1.8  2.1 cm-sized well-defined, solid, heterogeneous nodule that doesnt appear to involve the mandible. we also found a nodular lesion occupying the left floor of the mouth with abundant blood flow. no enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the submental or submandibular regions.
patient: so, what does that mean, doctor?
doctor: based on these findings, our initial clinical impression is that this could be a benign salivary gland tumor, dermoid cyst, or benign connective tissue neoplasm. we will need to schedule you for surgery via an intraoral approach to remove the tumor and further examine it.
patient: alright, so what will the surgery involve?
doctor: during the surgery, well make an elliptical incision around the periphery of the sublingual gland, and prepare a full-thickness tissue flap along the lingual aspect of the sublingual gland. after freeing the sublingual gland from its surrounding tissue, well find the well-circumscribed tumor without capsular extension beneath the body of the sublingual gland. well carefully free the submandibular gland duct and lingual nerve from the tumor surface, and completely excise the tumor along with the sublingual gland.
patient: i see. what happens after the surgery?
doctor: after the surgery, well fix the tissue sample with 10 formalin and submit it for histopathological diagnosis to determine the exact nature of the tumor.
patient: okay, thank you for explaining everything to me. im ready to proceed with the surgery and follow-up care.
doctor: youre welcome. well make sure to take good care of you during and after the surgery. if you have any questions or concerns, dont hesitate to reach out to us.","s: the patient reports a 6-month history of swelling in the left floor of the mouth, accompanied by difficulty swallowing. the patient denies experiencing pain or tongue paralysis. the patient feels slight pain upon palpation of the tumor.

doctor: your daughter mentioned that youve had an unsteady gait and needed assistance when moving. is that correct?
patient: yes, thats true. its been really hard for me to walk lately.
doctor: okay, lets review your vital signs from the day of admission. your temperature was 97.9 f, heart rate 68 beatsmin, blood pressure 13784 mmhg, and respiratory rate 18 breaths per minute. you were alert and oriented to person, place, and time. now, lets discuss your neurological examination findings. you showed right-sided hemiparesis and significant leg stiffness. your strength in your right arm was 45, and in your right leg, it was 35. your left side was unremarkable.
patient: yeah, ive been having difficulty moving my right side.
doctor: we also found that your cranial nerves 2-10 were normal, but you had difficulty shrugging your right shoulder and couldnt turn your head to the left. when walking, your gait was unsteady, and you compensated with your non-affected side. the rest of your physical examination was within normal limits.
patient: okay, what about the tests you did on me?
doctor: your laboratory values were within normal limits. we performed a head computed tomography ct and a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging mri, which were both negative for a stroke. however, your cervical spine ct showed marked degenerative changes, including moderate to severe spinal canal stenosis at c4c5.
patient: oh, what does that mean?
doctor: we performed an mri of your cervical spine without contrast, which confirmed the moderate to severe central stenosis with cord compression and mildly increased t2 signal at c4c5 and c5c6. there were degenerative findings between levels c3-c7, along with hypertrophy.

patient: how did the surgery go?
doctor: due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in calots triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct arhd was excessively exposed. we used a fundus-first technique to confirm the arhd after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of calots triangle. we confirmed that the arhd drained into the cystic duct.
patient: was there any need to preserve the arhd?
doctor: preoperative mrcp suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the arhd, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.
patient: so, what was done during the surgery?
doctor: we performed intraoperative cholangiography from the cystic duct in the periphery, which revealed that the arhd was not confluent with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct and drained a narrow area. we decided to remove the excessively exposed arhd.

"doctor: hello, i see that you are a 53-year-old woman with a posterior, stage iib nsclc in the left upper lobe. youve received neoadjuvant carboplatin, pemetrexed, and radiotherapy already. can you tell me if youve been experiencing any discomfort or new symptoms recently?
patient: yeah, doctor. ive been having severe left back pain and left axillary numbness and paresthesia.
doctor: i see. based on your symptoms, we conducted some tests and found that the tumor has attached to the t2 and t3 vertebrae and infiltrated the corresponding nerve roots. this is likely the cause of your complaints. we consulted the neurosurgery and thoracic surgery services to discuss the best management for your condition.
patient: what did they recommend, doctor?
doctor: the magnetic resonance imaging mri studies showed that there was no direct tumor invasion of the left brachial plexus or subclavian vessels. after discussing different treatment options, they recommended a posterior approach, image-guided t2 and t3 osteotomy followed by transthoracic en bloc resection of the thoracic tumor.
patient: will that help with the pain and numbness?
doctor: yes, the operation aims to address the issues caused by the tumor attachment and infiltration. youll need to give your informed consent for the procedure.
patient: alright, i agree to the operation.
doctor: great. during the operation, well make an initial incision in the operating room and expose the spinal processes, lamina, and transverse processes from t1 through t5 as well as 5 cm of the ribs from the left costovertebral junction on the side of the tumor. well then take images with the o-arm and register your spine to the stealthstation navigation suite using a stereotactic probe.
patient: what happens next?
doctor: well use spine navigation to place the instrumentation at the level above and below the tumor-infiltrated vertebrae. we wont place screws on the left t2 and t3 vertebrae. the spinous processes and lamina of t2 and t3 will be removed, and the nerve roots will be exposed on the left side.
patient: and then youll remove the tumor?
doctor: yes, during the resection, well notice an infiltration of the ganglia by the primary tumor that is in continuity with the ribs on the left side. well proceed with resection, tying the t2 and t3 nerve roots.

"doctor: good morning how can i help you today?
patient: hi, doctor. i am a 70-year-old woman and i was admitted to the cardiovascular department for chest distress for 11 hours. i have been experiencing shortness of breath at rest and difficulty laying in the recumbent position.
doctor: i see. have you had any prior medical conditions?
patient: yes, i was diagnosed with hypertension and diabetes mellitus a few years ago and have been taking oral medication for their treatment.
doctor: okay, let me explain what happened after your initial admission. after your clinical examination, you were diagnosed with coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. you underwent coronary angiography and stent implantation, and during the operation, heparin was administered, which included an arterial intrathecal injection of 2000 units and an intravenous injection of 3500 units.
patient: alright.
doctor: after the angiography, we prescribed you aspirin 100 mg per day, tigraylo 90 mg once every 12 h, and enoxaparin sodium 0.4 ml once every 12 h subcutaneously for 3 days. your chest distress and shortness of breath had relieved. however, on the third day after the operation, you were diagnosed with hematochezia without abdominal pain.
patient: oh, i see.
doctor: during the physical examination, we found mild abdominal tenderness, especially in your left lower quadrant, and some signs indicative of peritoneal irritation. there was also a neoplasm-like mucous clot connected to your bowel in the anus. we conducted some laboratory tests which showed declined levels of hemoglobin 102 gl, prolonged prothrombin time 13.4 s, and an international normalized ratio of 1.2.
patient: what does that mean?
doctor: these results indicate some issues with your blood clotting. moving on, we performed a colonoscopy and found a submucosal mass in your sigmoid colon, covered with a partially ruptured mucous membrane and some clots in the cavity, causing obstruction. an abdominal ct scan showed a submucosal hematoma in the sigmoid colon, and the density of the mass did not significantly change on an enhanced ct scan. the left flexure of the colon was also thick, which could be another hematoma.
patient: so, whats the treatment for this?
doctor: we tried conservative treatment, which included stopping your anticoagulant medications, providing total parenteral nutrition, and monitoring your condition. however, your clinical symptoms did not resolve with this approach. we will continue to evaluate your condition and discuss further treatment options with you.

"doctor: hi there i see youve presented with hoarseness and dysphagia for the past three months following an upper respiratory infection. can you tell me more about your symptoms?
patient: yeah, my voice has been really hoarse, and ive had trouble swallowing too.
doctor: i understand. i also noticed in your past medical history that you had invasive ductal carcinoma of the breast, which was er positive, pr negative, and her2 negative. you were treated with a mastectomy two years prior to this presentation. is that correct?
patient: yes, thats right.
doctor: during the clinical examination, we found paralysis of your right vocal cord. we also performed a ct scan of your neck, which revealed an enlarged thyroid gland with multiple bilateral thyroid nodules. have you experienced any other symptoms?
patient: no, not really. just the hoarseness and difficulty swallowing.
doctor: okay. we performed a fine needle aspiration fna of a right-sided 3.5 cm thyroid nodule, which was initially diagnosed as atypia of undetermined significance, falling under bethesda category iii. we did a repeat fna three months later, and it yielded a diagnosis of benign follicular nodule, which is bethesda category ii. 
patient: i see.
doctor: due to your persistent hoarseness and compressive symptoms, as well as the atypical findings on the initial fna, we decided to proceed with a right thyroid lobectomy and a right vocal cord injection. intraoperatively, we observed that your right thyroid lobe was moderately enlarged with multiple nodules but no evidence of extrathyroidal extension.
patient: oh, okay.
doctor: the right lobectomy specimen measured 4.6 cm in greatest dimension and weighed 16 grams. upon further examination, we found multiple variably sized brown gelatinous nodules with focal areas of hemorrhage and cystic change in the thyroid parenchyma.
patient: what does that mean?
doctor: the histologic examination revealed evidence of nodular thyroid hyperplasia. we also found multiple scattered subcentimeter foci of metastatic breast carcinoma, which were present in 7 out of the 16 submitted tissue sections. most of these smaller metastatic foci measured around 1 millimeter each and consisted of irregularly shaped nests of epithelioid tumor cells between thyroid follicles.
patient: oh, no.
doctor: the largest metastatic focus measured 0.6 cm and was comprised of tumor cell nests arranged along the periphery of a sclerotic stroma with cords of tumor cells showing retraction artifact. these areas resembled the dense amyloid-type stroma often seen in medullary thyroid carcinoma mtc. additionally, we observed numerous areas of rimming of the thyroid follicles by the tumor cells, which mimicked the appearance of c cell hyperplasia cch.

"doctor: hello, how can i help you today?
patient: hi, doctor. im a 48-year-old woman and ive noticed a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of my left ring finger. i have a history of enchondroma in the same location.
doctor: i see. lets perform an ultrasound examination to get a better understanding of the mass.
doctor conducts the ultrasound examination
doctor: the ultrasound examination revealed an exophytic hypoechoic mass that is connected to the medullary cavity through the interrupted bone cortex. there are no obvious blood signals or calcification in this area. unfortunately, its difficult to characterize or classify the mass using traditional ultrasound methods.
patient: oh, i see. so, what does that mean for me, doctor?
doctor: based on the ultrasound findings, we can confirm that there is a mass located close to the bone. however, due to the limitations of the ultrasound, we cannot precisely determine the nature of the mass. we have included these findings in our ultrasound diagnostic report.
patient: hmm, so whats the next step?
doctor: the next step would be a more detailed examination, such as an mri or a biopsy, to better understand the nature of the mass and determine the appropriate treatment options.
patient: okay, when can we schedule that?
doctor: ill have my assistant schedule the mri or biopsy for you as soon as possible. in the meantime, please monitor any changes in the mass or if you experience any discomfort or pain.
patient: alright, thank you, doctor.
doctor: youre welcome. well be in touch with you to schedule the further examination. please dont hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime.","s: the patient is a 48-year-old woman who reports a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of her left ring finger. she has a history of enchondroma in the same location. she expresses concern about the nature of the mass and potential treatment options.
o: ultrasound examination of the left ring finger revealed an exophytic hypoechoic mass connected to the medullary cavity through an interrupted bone cortex. there were no blood signals or calcifications noted in the area. the mass could not be fully characterized or classified with ultrasound alone.
a: the primary assessment is a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of the left ring finger, with a differential diagnosis including recurrence of enchondroma or other benign bone tumors. the absence of blood signals and calcifications on ultrasound reduces the likelihood of a malignant process, but further diagnostic workup is necessary to rule out other possibilities.
p: plan to schedule an mri and possibly a biopsy to further evaluate the nature of the mass and to determine appropriate treatment options. the patient will be monitored for any changes in the mass or symptoms such as discomfort or pain. follow-up appointments will be arranged post-imaging and biopsy results to discuss treatment strategies. the patient is advised to contact the clinic if she has any concerns or new symptoms in the meantime.","s: the patient is a 48-year-old woman presenting with a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of the left ring finger. she has a history of enchondroma in the same location.

pt: hey doc, ive been having some issues with memory lately. ive been experiencing recurrent amnesia when i wake up, with disorientation and repetitive questioning, which only lasts for a few minutes.
doctor: i see, any other symptoms youve been experiencing?
pt: yeah, ive also had these 30-second trance-like episodes during the day. my partner reported that sometimes i make repetitive swallowing movements, followed by disorientation and repetitive questioning. these episodes occur in clusters of up to seven per day.
doctor: are you aware of these episodes when they happen?
pt: well, im aware of some of them, but not all. i do have partial recollection of being unable to remember things during those times.
doctor: have you noticed any other changes in your memory?
pt: yes, ive noticed that i lose newly acquired memories over days, and i have difficulty recalling autobiographical events from my adulthood and familiar routes.
doctor: have you experienced any other symptoms along with these memory issues?
pt: ive developed olfactory hallucinations that smell like candy floss, which can last for up to a day and seem to happen independently of the amnestic episodes. i also feel like my sense of smell has become a bit blunted. plus, ive been having headaches with migrainous features, postural arm tremor, tingling in my legs, malaise, and low mood.
doctor: thank you for sharing that information. can you tell me about your medical history?
pt: my medical history is mostly unremarkable, but i did have symptoms of depression last year and a history of heavy alcohol use in the past.
doctor: based on your symptoms, we conducted several tests and investigations. your initial brain mri showed subtly increased t2 signal in the right hippocampus, even in the absence of any recent episodes. your eeg was normal, and the clinical examination revealed no focal neurological signs. we made an initial clinical diagnosis of tea.
doctor: we started treating you with lamotrigine, starting at 25 mg and gradually increasing it up to 100 mg twice a day. this resolved your trance-like and amnestic attacks. however, your other symptoms, such as headaches, tingling sensation in your limbs, and olfactory hallucinations, still persist.
pt: oh, okay. so whats the next step in my treatment plan?
doctor: since the lamotrigine has resolved your amnestic attacks, we will continue monitoring your progress and adjust the treatment as needed. we will also further investigate your other symptoms to find the best course of action. in the meantime, please keep track of your symptoms and report any changes to us.

doctor: immediately after endotracheal intubation, your systolic blood pressure increased from 130 to 145 mmhg, and your heart rate increased from 60 to 95 beats per minute bpm. two minutes later, your systolic blood pressure had decreased to 125 mmhg. propofol was continuously infused intravenously at a target concentration of 2 to 4 gml, and bis levels were maintained between 40 and 60.
patient: alright.
doctor: after an arterial catheter was placed, your position was changed from the supine to the right lateral position. surgery was then started.
patient: okay.
doctor: since no circulatory change associated with pain occurred during surgery, opioids were not administered. regarding hemodynamics, everything was stable throughout the procedure.
patient: thats good to hear.
doctor: yes, the surgery went well. please make sure to follow up with us for any post-operative concerns or further treatment. do you have any questions?
patient: no, i think you covered everything. thank you, doctor.

"doctor: hello, how can i help you today?
patient: hi, doctor. im a 65-year-old man and ive been experiencing reduced vision in both my eyes lately.
doctor: i see. can you tell me about your medical history? have you had any conditions or treatments in the past?
patient: yes, i was treated for small cell cancer of the lung and had chemotherapy for it. seven months ago, i had breathlessness and a pleural effusion was found during a routine examination. they also discovered a mycobacterial infection in the pleura.
doctor: it looks like you were treated with rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and inh for the mycobacterial infection. is that correct?
patient: yes, thats right. but i had drug-induced hepatitis, so they changed my regimen to rifampicin and ethambutol with the addition of levofloxacin.
doctor: alright, lets start by examining your eyes. first, well check your best-corrected visual acuity, which is 615 in both eyes. your extraocular movements and anterior segment examination seem normal. now, ill perform a dilated fundus examination. that looks normal as well.
patient: so, what could be causing my reduced vision?
doctor: lets conduct a visual-evoked potential vep test to get a better understanding of your condition. the vep results show reduced amplitude and prolonged latency in both eyes, suggestive of bilateral optic axonopathy.
patient: what does that mean?
doctor: it means there might be some damage to the optic nerves in both your eyes. to further investigate this, well need to do an mri scan.
patient: okay, what did the mri scan show?
doctor: the mri scan revealed multiple round peripherally enhancing lesions in both cerebral hemispheres and in the right cerebellum. moreover, central 30-2 perimetry revealed an incomplete left homonymous hemianopia with additional inferior temporal defects in the right eye.
patient: is it related to the medications ive been taking?
doctor: yes, based on these findings, it seems that ethambutol toxicity is the likely cause of your reduced vision, as the lesions in the cerebral hemispheres are not consistent with the perimetric findings.
patient: what should i do now? are there any treatment options?
doctor: there are treatments available, but its important to discuss them with your primary care physician and consider discontinuing ethambutol. however, i must let you know that the decision to proceed with any treatment is ultimately up to you.

doctor: i see. are there any other symptoms youve been experiencing, such as fever, diarrhoea, blurring of vision, or any difficulty or pain while swallowing?
patient: no, i havent had any fever, diarrhoea, blurring of vision, or odynophagia or dysphagia.
doctor: thank you for letting me know. i see that you first presented to us back in september 2016, when you were diagnosed with pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonitis pjp on transbronchial lung biopsy. you were successfully treated with co-trimoxazole and prednisolone. the biopsy didnt reveal any cmv inclusion bodies at that time. your cd4 count was 109l, and your hiv-1 viral load was 4.89 log copiesml. 
patient: yes, thats correct.
doctor: you were initially diagnosed with hiv-1 infection in 2000 and treated by another physician. you were started on zidovudine zdv, lamivudine 3tc, and nevirapine nvp, and then switched to tenofovir disproxil fumarate tdf, 3tc, atazanavir, and ritonavir atvr in 2011 due to virological failure. after controlling your pjp, we switched your haart to raltegravir ral, darunavir drv, and ritonavir based on the genotypic resistance report. 
patient: yes, i remember that.
doctor: so, within four weeks of initiating the new haart regimen, youve presented with these current symptoms. your physical examination showed icterus and tender hepatomegaly, but fundoscopy did not reveal any cmv retinitis. you have normocytic normochromic anaemia with a haemoglobin level of 10.7 gdl, and your total leucocyte and differential counts are within normal range.

"doctor: hi there, i understand youve been referred to our service for further management of your recurrent germ cell malignancy. can you tell me about your initial symptoms?
patient: yeah, i first noticed some abdominal bloating and i was told there was an 18-cm mass in my adnexal area.
doctor: thats correct. your tumor marker elevation at that time showed alpha-fetoprotein afp at 131.53 ngml, ca 125 at 521 uml, and lactate dehydrogenase ldh at 242 iul. you underwent a fertility-sparing staging surgery which included a unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, unilateral pelvic and para-aortic lymph node dissection, omentectomy, and cul-de-sac tumor excision. then, you received chemotherapy with 4 cycles of bep, which is bleomycin, etoposide, and cisplatin. is that right?
patient: yes, thats right. i was 14 years old when all of that happened.
doctor: the final pathology reported a mixed germ cell tumor, mainly composed of immature teratoma grade 3, figo stage iiic, pt3cn0m0 with components of embryonal carcinoma 23 and yolk sac tumor 3. now, during your follow-up, disease recurrence was suspected due to tumor marker elevation again afp: 118.82 ngml, ca 125: 58.82 uml and pelvic cystic lesions with ascites on abdominal computed tomography ct scan. thats why you were referred to us. have you noticed any new symptoms lately?
patient: i havent noticed anything major, but i do feel some discomfort in my pelvic area occasionally.
doctor: thank you for sharing that. in order to address the recurrence, you underwent a second fertility-sparing debulking surgery at our hospital. the intra-operative findings showed a 6  5-cm solid tumor at your omentum, another gray tan soft tissue measuring 5  3 cm upon your bladder, and some small cul-de-sac tumors. there was no residual disease noted. do you have any questions about the surgery?
patient: no, i think i understand what happened. what were the results of the surgery?
doctor: all the lesions were reported to be metastatic mixed germ cell tumors, mainly composed of an immature teratoma with focal areas of yolk sac tumors. the teratoma component is made up of squamous epithelium, intestinal-type epithelium, respiratory epithelium, mesenchymal tissue, and neuroglial tissue. the immature element is found focally and is composed of fetal-type epithelium and mesenchymal tissue. 
patient: oh, i see. what does this mean for my condition?
doctor: it means that the surgery was successful in removing the recurrent tumors. we will continue to monitor your tumor markers and perform regular ct scans to ensure there is no further recurrence. its important to keep an eye on your symptoms and report any changes or concerns to us.

"doctor: hi, how can i help you today?
patient: well, ive been severely affected by some mobility and balance issues since i was a kid.
doctor: i see. can you tell me when you first started to notice these difficulties?
patient: my parents first noticed my mobility and balance difficulties when i was around 2 years and 7 months old. i started walking independently at 8 months, but i could never ride a bicycle.
doctor: hmm, that must have been challenging. have you experienced any problems with activities that require fine motor skills, like using your hands?
patient: yes, ive always had significant problems with fine motor activity of both hands. since childhood, ive been unable to cut food by myself.
doctor: i understand. what kind of mobility aids do you use to help you get around?
patient: i require a pedestal walker and long leg braces to ambulate.
doctor: okay. have you noticed any changes in your voice over the years?
patient: my voice has been hoarse since i was 16, and i have documented vocal cord paralysis. i also develop shortness of breath after speaking for several minutes.
doctor: i see. let me conduct a neurological examination to better understand your condition. after the examination i found some weakness in your biceps and triceps muscles in your upper extremities and no movements in your intrinsic hand muscles, wrist extensors, or wrist flexors. in your lower extremities, there are trace movements of your hamstrings and no movements of your quadriceps, anterior tibialis, gastrocnemius, or intrinsic foot muscles.
patient: oh, that sounds bad...
doctor: your small fiber sensory modalities, like pin prick or light touch, are essentially normal, with only a mild decrease to pin prick on your right great toe. however, your large fiber sensory modalities are profoundly abnormal. you were unable to detect vibration with a rydell tuning fork at your toes, ankles, knees, and fingers. joint position was absent at your toes and left ankle, and reduced at both knees.
patient: i had no idea it was that extensive.
doctor: your compound muscle action potential cmap and sensory nerve action potential snap amplitudes were unobtainable, except for a markedly reduced axillar nerve cmap. based on these findings, your cmt neuropathy score is in the severe range of 28 out of 36.
patient: what does that mean for me?
doctor: this means that your condition is quite severe, and its important to continue using your mobility aids and seek appropriate treatment and therapy to maintain your quality of life. i will provide you with some recommendations and resources to help you manage your symptoms.

"doctor: hello, how can i help you today?
patient: hi, i got this high voltage electrical burn on my scalp and i was treated with dressing for 10 days in another hospital. but now, i have a fever and an infected wound.
doctor: i see. do you have any history of immune compromise?
patient: no, i dont.
doctor: alright. well have to do a debridement of your scalp to remove the infected tissue. unfortunately, even after the debridement, you may still have a sustained fever and raised counts.
patient: oh, okay.
doctor: two days after the debridement, well do a clinical examination. we might find hyphae over the wound margin and gangrenous changes over your scalp surrounding the wound.
patient: that sounds serious.
doctor: yes, this could be an invasive fungal infection called zygomycosis. well start you on an injection of amphotericin b and take you for a wide debridement. well also take a tissue biopsy for histopathology examination.
patient: alright.
doctor: during the procedure, well perform outer bony cortex chiseling with a high-speed diamond burr. the histopathology report will help us identify the specific fungus causing the infection, which in your case is a. corymbifera. intravenous amphotericin b injection will be continued for a 4-week period since diagnosis to complete healing.
patient: okay, i understand.
doctor: after two weeks of anti-fungal treatment, your clinical condition should improve. once we confirm the absence of the fungal infection, well cover the scalp defect with a free anterior lateral thigh flap.

"doctor: hello there, i see you have a history of hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. what brings you here today?
patient: well, i was admitted to the hospital after an open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture. i was treated with unfractionated heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
doctor: i understand. how have you been feeling since then?
patient: on the fourth day, i developed acute shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. the doctors did a dvt and pulmonary embolism workup.
doctor: and what did they find?
patient: they found both a dvt and a subocclusive saddle-shaped pulmonary embolism. they started me on a continuous heparin infusion for treatment.
doctor: i see. did you experience any other symptoms after that?
patient: yes, the following day, i developed sudden left-sided weakness and rightward gaze deviation.
doctor: that sounds concerning. it seems like you had an acute ischemic stroke. did they perform any imaging tests to confirm this?
patient: yes, they did a ct angiogram of the head and neck and an mri of my brain. they found that the stroke was caused by right-sided common carotid artery occlusion with thrombus extending into the external and internal carotid arteries.
doctor: did they find anything else on the imaging?
patient: they also noted a tandem occlusion of the inferior branch of the right middle cerebral artery on cerebral angiography.
doctor: so, what was the next step in your treatment?
patient: the doctors performed a successful mechanical thrombectomy of the right carotid artery bifurcation thrombus.
doctor: thats great to hear. how did your platelet count look after the procedure?
patient: my platelet count dropped from 153,000l to 94,000l, which raised suspicion for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. they stopped the heparin infusion and started me on continuous bivalirudin infusion instead.
doctor: did they perform any additional tests to confirm the suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia?
patient: yes, they sent pf4-h ab and sra tests.
doctor: what were the results of those tests?
patient: the tests came back negative, and my platelet count started to uptrend to 105,000l.
doctor: thats good news. since the tests were negative, what was their next step?
patient: they stopped the bivalirudin infusion and restarted me on therapeutic continuous heparin infusion due to reduced suspicion of hit.
doctor: did they perform any other tests during your stay at the hospital?
patient: yes, they did a transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study, which revealed a patent foramen ovale with right to left shunting. they think the cause of my stroke was a paradoxical embolism.
doctor: i see. how has your platelet count been since then?
patient: from day 8, my platelets started to downtrend to 36,000l.

doctor: we performed an eye examination and although there wasnt any papilledema, it was suspicious for mild peripheral loss of vision. were there any issues in your past medical history?
patient: no, ive been healthy and developing normally.
doctor: alright. at presentation, you did not have diencephalic syndrome. we conducted a brain mri which demonstrated the presence of a large lobulated multicompartmental supra-sellar mass, centered within the hypothalamusoptic chiasm, measuring 5.4cm x 3.4cm x 5cm. this mass has some effect on the midbrain and third ventricle, causing obstructive hydrocephalus.
patient: oh no, that sounds serious.
doctor: yes, it is a serious condition. we performed an endoscopic biopsy and septostomy, along with a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal vp shunt to manage your hydrocephalus. the pathology of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of a low-grade glioma. it was braf-v600e negative on immunohistochemistry but positive on next-generation sequencing.
patient: what does that mean for my treatment?
doctor: we started you on chemotherapy with vincristine and carboplatin. unfortunately, your tumor showed rapid progression with worsening hydrocephalus six weeks into chemotherapy.
patient: oh, thats not good.
doctor: no, its not. due to the progression, you developed further complications like progressive right-sided hemiparesis, bitemporal hemianopia, central hypothyroidism, and feeding difficulties requiring a gastrostomy tube and placement of a second vp shunt.

"doctor: hi there, i understand youre here for a dermatological evaluation today. can you please tell me what concerns you have about your skin?
patient: yeah, i have this brown papule on my upper back, and its within a large tattoo. im not really sure how long its been there or if it was there when i got the tattoo.
doctor: i see. let me take a closer look. hmm, it appears to be an 8-millimeter flat, brown papule. since were uncertain about the lesions initial presentation, pattern of growth, and appearance, i would recommend a shave removal of the lesion to examine it further. how does that sound?
patient: okay, i guess that sounds fine.
after the shave removal and excision
doctor: we have examined the original excision, and it showed an atypical intraepidermal melanocytic proliferation. the dermis also contained scattered foci of tattoo pigment and fibrosis. its important to note that an early evolving melanoma in situ couldnt be excluded at that time.
patient: oh, that doesnt sound good.
doctor: dont worry, we took further action by re-excising the lesion with a 5-millimeter margin. upon examination, no residual melanocytic lesion was detected, only scar tissue was present. this is a positive sign.

"doctor: hi there, can you please tell me what brings you here today?
patient: well, ive had a history of intermittent, severe epigastric pain.
doctor: i see. how long have you been experiencing this pain?
patient: its been happening for the past 5 months. the pain usually comes 15-30 minutes after every meal, but its less severe and goes away on its own.
doctor: okay, lets review your test results. your full blood count, serum biochemistry values, and c-reactive protein level are within normal ranges. your arterial gas analysis is also normal. however, your abdominal plain radiography showed free air between the liver and diaphragm, and pi fig.. additionally, abdominal computed tomography showed severe calcification of the sma origin sma peripheral flow was reserved fig.. computed tomography ct revealed bubble-like intramural gas of the small bowel with the contrasted wall pneumoperitoneum fig..
patient: hmm, that sounds concerning. what does that all mean?
doctor: since you dont have peritonitis, we decided to take a conservative approach. we managed your condition in the intensive care unit due to potential risks of acute mesenteric ischemia from mesenteric artery occlusion or non-occlusive mesenteric ischemia. you were treated for bowel obstruction, which included fasting and intravenous fluid administration. you also received heparin infusion to prevent sma occlusion and maintain collateral flow.
patient: yes, i remember that. i actually felt some relief from my abdominal pain during my stay in the icu.
doctor: thats good to hear. seven days after admission, your abdominal plain radiography showed improvement in pi and pneumoperitoneum. so, we allowed you to start drinking fluids. did you experience any pain after consuming fluids?
patient: no, i didnt have any recurrent abdominal pain after drinking fluids.
doctor: great. since there was no pain, we allowed you to eat solid food as well. now, we had planned an angiography to further investigate and potentially relieve your postprandial abdominal pain. the findings showed severe stenosis of the sma origin with calcification, and the sma had replaced the common hepatic artery fig., . we performed et, namely stenting to the sma and common hepatic artery.
patient: how was the procedure done?
doctor: we engaged the sma trunk with a 6f parent plus 60 guiding catheter medikit, tokyo, japan from your left brachial artery. initially, we infused 8000 units of heparin, and added additional heparin to keep your activated whole blood clotting time over 200 seconds.
patient: i see. so, whats next for me?
doctor: now that the procedure is done, we will continue to monitor your condition closely. its essential to maintain a proper diet and follow up with your appointments regularly. if you notice any recurrence of abdominal pain or any new symptoms, please contact us immediately.
patient: okay, thank you, doctor. i will follow your advice and keep an eye on my condition.","s: the patient reports a 5-month history of intermittent, severe epigastric pain occurring 15-30 minutes postprandially, which self-resolves. no recurrent abdominal pain was noted after starting fluid intake post-treatment.

"doctor: hi, i understand youve been evaluated for persistent hyponatremia, which has been going on for about a month. can you tell me about any symptoms youve experienced during this duration?
patient: yeah, ive been feeling really tired and confused lately. i also noticed some unexplained weight loss.
doctor: your physical exam didnt show any signs of volume overload or depletion, which is good. however, your workup revealed a sodium level of 126 mmoll without other electrolyte abnormalities, serum osmolality of 260 mosmkg, serum uric acid level of 2.0 mgdl, normal cortisol, normal tsh, urine sodium of 45 mmoll, and urine osmolality of 274 mosmkg. these findings are consistent with a condition called siadh. you were taking citalopram, which we thought might have been the cause, so we stopped it. however, your hyponatremia persisted, so we did some more tests, especially considering your extensive smoking history.
patient: yeah, ive been a smoker for a long time.
doctor: we performed a computed tomography ct scan, which showed a right hilar mass with metastasis to the liver, right femur, and ribs. a biopsy revealed that you have small cell lung cancer sclc.
patient: oh no, thats terrible.
doctor: i understand this is difficult news, but its important to address it. ive noticed that youve continued to smoke cigarettes even after the sclc diagnosis. about two weeks later, you were admitted for acute hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure due to postobstructive pneumonia, copd exacerbation, and secondary pneumothorax. we managed these issues, and there was some improvement in your respiratory status.
patient: yeah, my breathing got a bit better after that.
doctor: however, your paco2 and serum bicarbonate levels began to increase, with the bicarbonate level approaching up to 45 meqdl. this was associated with refractory hypokalemia and uncontrolled hypertension. we noticed metabolic alkalosis, which was chloride resistant, as your urine chloride was 20 meqdl. your hyponatremia responded moderately to fluid restriction and gradually normalized after the onset of metabolic alkalosis.
patient: so, what does that mean for me?
doctor: well, with uncontrolled hypertension and the presence of chloride-resistant metabolic alkalosis and hypokalemia, we decided to conduct a workup for hyperaldosteronism. your serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity were within normal limits, so we proceeded with a high-dose dexamethasone suppression test.
patient: what did the test show?
doctor: the test revealed elevations of acth 319 pgml and cortisol 131.5 gdl, consistent with acth-dependent hypercortisolism and a condition called same, which is caused by an ectopic nonsuppressible source of acth. furthermore, youve experienced significant weight loss of 28 pounds after your sclc diagnosis and profound muscle wasting.
patient: thats a lot to take in. whats next for me?
doctor: well be working closely with you to create a personalized treatment plan to address both your sclc and the metabolic issues. its important to follow up with your medical team and monitor your symptoms. well do our best to support you through this process.

"doctor: hello, i understand that you were referred to us for management of fetal demise. can you tell me about your antenatal visits and any symptoms youve experienced during your pregnancy?
patient: yes, i attended 3 antenatal visits at a health center. they documented my fundal height at each visit and gave me routine care. i had occasional painful fetal kicks, but i was otherwise well throughout the antenatal period.
doctor: its good that you had regular visits. when did you start to notice reduced fetal movements?
patient: hmm, about three days before i got admitted to your service, i noticed the reduced movements, so i consulted at the health center, and they said it was fetal demise.
doctor: i see. when you were admitted to our unit, we checked your vital parameters and found them to be stable. there was no abdominal tenderness, and your fundal height was 32cm. fetal parts were not easily palpable, and we couldnt perceive fetal heart tones. also, there were no signs of per vaginal bleeding. your cervix was long, posterior, firm, and closed. we requested an emergency ultrasound scan, which confirmed the fetal demise and showed gross cranial deformation. however, it didnt diagnose an intra-abdominal location.
patient: thats really sad. so, what did you do next?
doctor: we started cervical ripening with 50g of misoprostol vaginally every 6 hours. after 4 applications, your cervix remained unchanged. so, we decided to proceed with operative delivery to avoid failed induction and reduce the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
patient: what did you find during the operation?
doctor: the intraoperative findings showed a third-degree macerated female fetus floating freely in the peritoneal cavity, weighing 2650g with a tight cord round her neck, and there was no amniotic sac. the uterus was about 14 weeks, and the fallopian tubes and ovaries were normal. the placenta was implanted on the ascending colon and mesocolon. we decided to leave the placenta in place as there were no intraoperative complications encountered.
patient: what treatment did i receive after the operation?
doctor: postoperatively, you were placed on ampicillin, gentamycin, and metronidazole parenterally for five days to prevent infection. additionally, you received 50mg of methotrexate every other day for 4 doses, along with 5mg of folinic acid each day following the methotrexate treatment.
patient: when can i expect to be discharged?
doctor: you were discharged on day 8 postoperation to continue your recovery at home.

"doctor: hello, how can i help you today?
patient: hi, im here because i fell from a bunk bed nine days ago and i hurt my left wrist. i got it checked at another facility and they put a splint on it, but i wanted a second opinion.
doctor: i see. do you have a history of any other medical issues or injuries?
patient: hmm, well, ive had some issues with intravenous drug abuse and ive been incarcerated before.
doctor: thank you for sharing that information. lets take a look at your wrist. ill need to remove the splint and take new x-rays to assess the situation.
patient: sure, go ahead.
doctor takes x-rays
doctor: your x-rays show that the fracture is highly comminuted, meaning there are many small, intra-articular fragments. to restore overall radiographic parameters and stability, well use ligamentotaxis with a 2.42.7 mm synthes dorsal bridge plate. well also add percutaneously placed k wires for extra stabilization of the radial styloid and lunate facet.
patient: okay, so what does that involve?
doctor: well make two incisions, one over the index metacarpal and one over the radial shaft. we wont open the third dorsal extensor compartment at the level of the wrist, which is a contrast to others techniques. the plate will be placed deep to the extensor tendons in the proximal, radial shaft incision. well leave the k wire ends outside the skin to allow staged hardware removal without multiple trips to the operating room.
patient: got it. and after the procedure, what will my recovery look like?
doctor: postoperative x-rays will show improved radial inclination and articular congruity, with some residual slight dorsal tilt. youll return for regular follow-up visits, and well remove the two k wires in the clinic about 4 weeks after surgery. at that point, you should be able to extend your thumb at the interphalangeal joint.
patient: that sounds good. is there anything else i should know?
doctor: plate removal will be discussed during your follow-up visits, but its important to keep attending those appointments. in some cases, patients might experience sensations like clicking with wrist motion or difficulty extending their thumb. if that happens, well need to address it.
patient: okay, ill make sure to come to my follow-up visits. thank you for explaining everything to me.
doctor: youre welcome. if you have any questions or concerns during your recovery, or if you experience any new trauma to your wrist or hand, please dont hesitate to reach out.","s: the patient, a history of intravenous drug abuse and incarceration, presents nine days post-fall from a bunk bed with a chief complaint of pain in the left wrist. initially treated with a splint at another facility, the patient seeks a second opinion due to persistent discomfort.
o: examination and x-rays of the left wrist reveal a highly comminuted fracture with multiple intra-articular fragments. the fracture affects the radial styloid and lunate facet. planned surgical intervention includes the use of a 2.42.7 mm synthes dorsal bridge plate and percutaneously placed k wires for stabilization.
a: the primary diagnosis is a comminuted intra-articular fracture of the left wrist. the planned surgical approach aims to restore radial inclination, articular congruity, and overall wrist stability, while minimizing the risk of complications such as non-union or malunion due to the patients complex fracture pattern.
p: the patient will undergo surgery involving the placement of a dorsal bridge plate and k wires. postoperative care will include regular follow-up visits to monitor healing and hardware integrity, with k wires removal scheduled approximately 4 weeks post-surgery. the patient is advised to attend all follow-up appointments and report any new symptoms such as clicking or difficulty extending the thumb. plate removal will be evaluated during follow-up. the patient is encouraged to contact healthcare providers if experiencing any new trauma or concerns during recovery.","s: the patient, a male with a history of intravenous drug abuse, reports falling from a bunk bed nine days ago, reports experiencing clicking with wrist motion and difficulty extending their thumb. he describes the pain and describes the history of his wrist. he also mentions the importance of regular follow-up visits with a second opinion.
o: physical examination revealed a highly comminuted fracture of the left wrist, commingled with a 2.7 mm dorsal bridge plate. ligamentotaxis with 2.42.5 mm k wires was used, which was performed under two incisions over the index metacarpal and one over the radial shaft, with two percutaneously placed k wires for extra stabilization of the radial styloid and lunate facet. postoperative x-rays showed improved radial inclination and articular congruity, with residual slight dorsal tilt.
a: the primary diagnosis is a high-comminuted left wrist fracture, likely secondary to a dislocation of the third dorsal extensor compartment. differential diagnoses could include other causes of wrist pain, but these are less likely given the nature of the fracture. the prognosis depends on the severity of the injury and the recovery process.

doctor: i see. when you arrived at the emergency department, you were anemic and unresponsive with active vaginal bleeding. our physical examination revealed hypotension with a blood pressure of 8060 mmhg, tachycardia at 138 beatsmin, and tachypnea at 26 breathsmin. your conjunctiva was anemic, and you had perioral cyanosis, cold  mottled extremities, and prolonged capillary refill time of more than 3 seconds. we also found that you had a total uterine inversion and perineal lacerations.
patient: oh, that sounds terrible. what did you do to help me?
doctor: we immediately performed bloodwork upon your admission, which showed anemia with haemoglobin at 5.9 gdl, hematocrit at 17.4, and erythrocyte count at 2.07 millionul. you also had leukocytosis with a white blood cell count of 22,000ul, but your thrombocyte level was normal at 358,000ul.
patient: so what was the treatment?
doctor: we treated you with fluid resuscitation using both colloids and crystalloids, along with blood transfusion and uterotonics. we successfully performed a manual reposition of your uterus and applied internal bimanual compression for 15 minutes. however, you still had profuse hemorrhage due to uterine atony.
patient: how did you manage that?
doctor: we placed a balloon tamponade to stop the hemorrhage and reduce the risk of recurrence. thankfully, your condition stabilized, and we didnt need to perform surgical management or a hysterectomy. we then repaired your perineal lacerations once the bleeding was under control.
patient: im glad to hear that. how am i doing now?
doctor: after transfusing 4 packed red cells, we repeated your bloodwork. your hemoglobin is now at 10 gdl, hematocrit at 29, erythrocyte count at 3.66 millionul, leucocyte count at 20,900ul, and thrombocyte count at 159,000ul. you have shown significant improvement.
patient: thats a relief. whats next for me?
doctor: we will continue to monitor your condition closely. it is important to have follow-up appointments with your healthcare provider to ensure your complete recovery.","s: 24-year-old primigravid female presented to the emergency department after childbirth, reporting heavy vaginal bleeding and loss of consciousness following placental delivery with placental traction. she described a large mass emerging through the vaginal passage alongside the placenta.

doctor: good to know. do you have any muscle contracture or pain when i press on the area?
patient: no, i dont have any contracture, and it doesnt hurt when you press on it.
doctor: can you show me exactly where the pain is located?
patient: its about 3 cm from the thoracic midline on the right side, and i feel some intercostal irradiation too.
doctor: thank you for that information. based on the radiographs we took, we didnt find any osteolysis or deformity. however, the mri showed a t2 hypersignal and a t1 hyposignal at the medial side of your right t1 vertebra, along with inflammation of the right t1 root. the radioisotope bone scanning also revealed lateral hyperfixation on the right side of your t1 vertebra.
patient: oh, i see. what does that mean?
doctor: the ct scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of your right t1 pedicle. the lesion is close to the dura mater and t1 spinal nerve, which is causing the inflammation and pain youre experiencing. the aspect of the lesion is compatible with a condition called osteoid osteoma.
patient: what can be done about it?
doctor: our team recommends a surgical resection using a posterior approach with 3d imaging guidance. because the lesion is so close to the dura mater, we cannot perform radiofrequency ablation, which would require thermal ablation. the surgery should be safe and complete, with no risk of recurrence. well also make sure to preserve the vertebral stability without needing screw fixation.
patient: what should i expect during the surgery?
doctor: youll be in a prone position under general anesthesia. well use a new all-in-one imaging device called surgivisio to control the vertebral level in two-dimensional 2d mode. this machine is a 2d3d c-arm designed to be combined with surgical navigation. well perform a mini-open posterior approach at the c7-t2 levels.

patient: no, they didnt do a ct chest initially because my creatinine was elevated at 1.6.
doctor: right, so instead they did a ventilationperfusion scan, or vq scan, which showed intermediate probability for pulmonary thromboembolism. we decided to continue your anticoagulation. however, you still had persistent tachycardia, and blood tests showed hypocalcemia at 6.8-7.9 mgdl and hypokalemia at 3.2-3.4 meql, but your thyroid function was normal.
patient: oh, i didnt know that.
doctor: we also found that your 25-hydroxyvitamin d test was low at 6 ngml, and your intact parathyroid hormone was elevated at 85.1 pgml. as a result, we put you on metoprolol 50 mg twice daily and continued intravenous hydration with electrolyte supplementation. we eventually did a ct chest which confirmed the presence of old embolism and showed a 1.1 cm nodule in your left upper lobe.
patient: so, whats the plan now?
doctor: weve consulted endocrinology for your persistent tachycardia with relatively stable blood pressure. you also had spikes of temperature for two days, so we started you on tamiflu and rocephin while waiting for blood culture results.
patient: okay, i understand. but i really want to be discharged and go home.

"doctor: hello, i understand you were admitted to our hospital last month with left quadrant abdominal pain and weight loss for more than 6 months. can you tell me more about your symptoms?
patient: yes, the pain gets worse after eating, and i also experience abdominal distension, belching, and reduced flatus.
doctor: have you tried any treatments for these symptoms before coming here?
patient: i was taking some traditional chinese medicine that temporarily relieved the symptoms.
doctor: i see. do you have any medical history we should know about?
patient: yes, i have a history of hypertension, but my control has been poor.
doctor: thank you for sharing that information. it looks like you underwent a colonoscopy examination in a local hospital. what were the results of that examination?
patient: they verbally reported no pathologic findings.
doctor: alright, during your physical examination here, we found mesogastric tenderness and an enlarged spleen. your blood laboratory examination reported only mild hypokalemia, and your urinary and stool reports were normal. enhanced computerized tomography showed splenomegaly, jejunal wall edema, narrowed lumen, enlarged lymph nodes, mesenteric edema, atrophy of the right liver lobe, hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, calcification, and periportal fibrosis. these signs are compatible with hepatic schistosomiasis.
patient: oh, that sounds serious.
doctor: yes, it is a condition that needs attention. during the double balloon enteroscopy, we noticed that your blood pressure was not stable, so we couldnt reexamine the colon. the upper enteroscopy showed an ulcer 150 cm distal to the treitz ligament, measuring 3.0 x 2.0 cm. the ulcer had a white coating and peripheral mucosal hyperemia, occupying 23 of the lumen, making it difficult for the endoscope to pass through. we took four biopsies from the ulcer, and 20 cm proximal from the ulcer, we found many scattered irregular ulcers, from which we took two biopsies.
patient: what did the histopathological examination reveal?
doctor: the examination reported chronic jejunal inflammation with ulcerative changes and old s. japonicum eggs deposition.
patient: what treatment did i receive during my hospitalization?
doctor: you received symptomatic treatment with intravenous fluids, electrolytes, antispasmodic medication, and proton-pump inhibitors.
patient: i remember now. unfortunately, i had to request a voluntary discharge from the hospital and decided to continue my treatment and follow-up at a local hospital.
doctor: its important to continue your treatment and follow-up, even if its at a different hospital. please make sure to keep your appointments and monitor your symptoms closely. if you have any concerns or questions, dont hesitate to reach out to your healthcare provider.","s: the patient reports a history of left quadrant abdominal pain worsening postprandially, accompanied by abdominal distension, belching, and reduced flatus. the symptoms have persisted for over six months. the patient has a history of hypertension with poor control and has used traditional chinese medicine for symptom relief. no pathologic findings were reported from a previous colonoscopy.
o: physical examination revealed mesogastric tenderness and splenomegaly. laboratory tests showed mild hypokalemia urinary and stool reports were normal. enhanced ct indicated splenomegaly, jejunal wall edema, narrowed lumen, enlarged lymph nodes, mesenteric edema, atrophy of the right liver lobe, hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, calcification, and periportal fibrosis, suggesting hepatic schistosomiasis. double balloon enteroscopy was limited due to unstable blood pressure however, upper enteroscopy revealed a significant ulcer in the jejunum and multiple scattered irregular ulcers. histopathology confirmed chronic jejunal inflammation with ulcerative changes and old s. japonicum eggs deposition.
a: the primary diagnosis is hepatic schistosomiasis with associated chronic jejunal inflammation and ulceration. differential diagnoses could include other causes of chronic abdominal pain and malabsorption, but imaging and histopathology strongly support schistosomiasis. the prognosis depends on effective management of the infection and associated complications.
p: the patient received symptomatic treatment with intravenous fluids, electrolytes, antispasmodic medication, and proton-pump inhibitors during hospitalization. the patient opted for voluntary discharge and plans to continue treatment and follow-up at a local hospital. it is crucial to maintain consistent follow-up, monitor symptoms, and adhere to prescribed treatments. referral to an infectious disease specialist for schistosomiasis management and a gastroenterologist for ongoing care of jejunal ulcers is recommended. education on the importance of blood pressure control and compliance with hypertension management should also be provided.","s: the patient, a male with a history of hypertension, presents with left quadrant abdominal pain and weight loss for over 6 months, accompanied by abdominal distension, belching, and reduced flatus. he reports no previous treatments for these symptoms. he has been taking traditional chinese medicine temporarily relieved the symptoms.

"doctor: hello, i see that youve been referred to our hospital due to a mass that was incidentally discovered in your right kidney. is that correct?
patient: yes, thats right.
doctor: the mass is 16-mm in size and located in the anterior medial position of your kidney. we performed a renal biopsy, which confirmed that its renal cell carcinoma, a type of kidney cancer.
patient: oh no, thats terrible.
doctor: i understand your concern. we have a treatment plan to address this issue. we placed a hook wire in the tumor with the help of an interventional radiologist and ct guidance.
patient: whats the purpose of that?
doctor: the hook wire helps us localize the tumor during surgery. its a technique we use for nonpalpable breast lesions to facilitate intraoperative localization. we will perform a partial nephrectomy to remove the tumor.
patient: how does the surgery work?
doctor: you will be placed in a modified left lateral decubitus position, and we will establish pneumoperitoneum. trocars will be placed to access your abdomen. we will mobilize your bowel medially and develop the plane between the anterior gerotas fascia and the posterior mesocolon.
patient: okay, and then?
doctor: your kidney will be mobilized within gerotas fascia. we will locate the hook wire and clamp the renal artery with a bulldog. the renal capsule will be resected using scissors under warm ischemia, which will take about 25 minutes.
patient: how will you stop the bleeding?
doctor: hemostasis will be achieved using a combination of cautery, hemostatic agents, and suturing. we will use sutures preloaded with clips to secure a suture line, allowing for lateral compression perpendicular to the renal capsule.
patient: what will the results be like?
doctor: the histopathology report confirmed clear-cell renal carcinoma with negative surgical margins. according to the tnm 2017 classification, its stage pt1a.

"doctor: hi there, i understand youve been suffering from hcc with multiple lung metastases for the past 3 months. youre a hepatitis b carrier, correct?
patient: yes, thats right.
doctor: i see that you were admitted complaining of a headache. we performed a brain mri scan to check for any brain metastasis. the results showed a solid mass occupying your left nasal cavity, measuring 3.7  1.8  2.8 cm.
patient: oh, that doesnt sound good.
doctor: yes, the mass showed iso-signal intensity on the t1 weighted image, high signal intensity on the t2 weighted image, and heterogeneous well enhancement on the gd-t1 weighted image. gradient-echo images also showed small foci of low signal, suggesting haemorrhage in the mass.
patient: hmm, what does that mean?
doctor: this means that there might be bleeding within the mass. we didnt find any restricted diffusion in the mass on diffusion-weighted imaging dwi and the apparent diffusion coefficient adc map. metastasis of hcc was suggested, as your nasal cavity was normal on a positron emission tomography ct scan that had been performed 3 months ago.
patient: i see. i have developed some symptoms like left nasal obstruction, clear rhinorrhea, and left facial pain.
doctor: those symptoms are consistent with the mass in your nasal cavity. we performed an excisional biopsy with a ct scan 17 days after the mri scan. it showed that the mass had rapidly increased in size to 6.2  2.2  3.4 cm, with involvement of the ostium of the nasolacrimal duct and the lateral wall of the anterior nasal cavity.
patient: wow, thats a big change.
doctor: yes, it is. there was no calcification in the mass on the pre-contrast ct scan. we conducted a punch biopsy and the histological examination revealed tumor cells with enlarged nucleoli and clear cytoplasm arranged in trabecular cords and glandular arrays, consistent with metastatic hcc.

"doctor: hi, im dr. smith, the specialist you were referred to by your primary care physician. can you tell me about the problem youve been experiencing?
patient: hello, dr. smith. my primary care doctor noticed that my tonsils were enlarged during an examination of my oral cavity. the right one is slightly larger than the left, but there wasnt any surface abnormality.
doctor: i see. and did your doctor prescribe any medication for it?
patient: yes, they prescribed me two courses of amoxicillin, but it didnt help me improve.
doctor: alright. ive reviewed your medical history and it seems to be unremarkable. we also did not find any cervical lymphadenopathy, significant systemic symptoms, malignancy, or immunocompromise. your laboratory parameters were within normal limits as well.
patient: thats good to hear.
doctor: we conducted a magnetic resonance mr imaging test to look for any mass lesions in your tonsils, but no obvious mass was found. however, the images did show that the right tonsil is larger than the left.
patient: hmm, okay.
doctor: on the axial t2-weighted image and postgadolinium t1-weighted image with fat saturation, we did not find any mass in the right tonsil. the left tonsil showed mucosal crypts with linear enhancement, but on the right side, the crypts were partly obliterated by a large mass and did not display enhancement.
patient: oh, i see.
doctor: due to the possibility of malignancy, we decided to perform a complete surgical resection of the right tonsil.

patient: hi, doctor. i dont have any history of significant alcohol use, and my viral hepatitis serologies were negative for hepatitis a, b, and c.
doctor: i noticed that your ferritin level was 319 ngml, which makes hemochromatosis unlikely. your anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies were also negative. so, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are unlikely in the absence of other clinical findings. we also considered wilsons disease, but your serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, and you did not have any psychiatric symptoms.
patient: yeah, thats right. i also remember that my -1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mgdl.
doctor: based on your medical history, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease nafld seems to be the most probable explanation for your cirrhosis, given that you have type 2 diabetes mellitus, a body mass index bmi of 29.83, and hyperlipidemia. however, youve been taking methotrexate for more than 10 years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which could also be a contributing factor.

doctor: thats good to hear. now, lets proceed with the examination. i noticed an exophytic pink to white gelatinous mass occupying about 70 of the central cornea on his right eye fig. a. his dazzle reflex seems inconsistent, and his menace response is negative. ill perform a fluorescein staining to check for any corneal damage.
patient: alright, what did you find?
doctor: the fluorescein staining was negative. i also conducted a slit lamp biomicroscopy examination, which showed a severe increase in corneal thickness, pigment deposit, and superficial vascularization. the mass seems to be infiltrating the corneal stroma.
patient: oh, that doesnt sound good.
doctor: we also performed a schirmer tear test-1 and measured the intraocular pressure by applanation tonometry. both of these tests were within normal limits. however, we couldnt perform an indirect ophthalmoscopy.
patient: and what about his left eye?
doctor: the ophthalmic exam of the left eye was unremarkable, and no abnormalities were observed on the physical examination.
patient: so, whats the diagnosis for his right eye?
doctor: at this time, we suspect it may be corneal neoplasia. other differential diagnoses include granulation tissue and a chronic inflammatory process. to confirm the diagnosis, we performed an excisional superficial keratectomy under general anesthesia.
patient: what did you find from that procedure?
doctor: the histological findings were consistent with corneal carcinoma. we proceeded with transconjunctival enucleation to remove the mass.
patient: and what happens after that?
doctor: we have fixed the globe, conjunctiva, and nictitant membrane in 10 neutral buffered formalin and submitted it for histopathologic examination. well be able to provide more information once we have the results.
patient: thank you, doctor. i appreciate all your help.","s: the patient, a 7-year-old male french bulldog, presented with a chief complaint of a corneal mass on the right eye, which has been enlarging over the past 2 months. the dog had a history of complete excision of the third eyelid gland 5 years ago, followed by the development of keratoconjunctivitis sicca, currently managed with cyclosporine eye drops and artificial tears.
o: physical examination revealed an exophytic pink to white gelatinous mass occupying about 70 of the central cornea on the right eye. the dog displayed an inconsistent dazzle reflex and a negative menace response. fluorescein staining was negative. slit lamp biomicroscopy showed increased corneal thickness, pigment deposit, and superficial vascularization with stromal infiltration. schirmer tear test-1 and intraocular pressure were within normal limits. the left eye and other physical examinations were unremarkable. histological examination of the excised mass confirmed corneal carcinoma.

"doctor: hello, i see from your history that you have osteoarthritis and hypothyroidism. what brings you in today?
patient: hi, doc. i noticed a rapidly growing lesion near my left eye about 3 weeks ago, and its been growing ever since. my primary care physician referred me to you.
doctor: i see. lets take a look at the lesion. upon examination, it appears to be a medial orbital mass causing ectropion of the lower eyelid and symptomatic epiphora. we should perform a ct scan of the orbits to further investigate this lesion.
patient: alright, doc. what did the ct scan results show?
doctor: the ct scan showed a 2.0  1.6  1.0 cm nonenhancing intraorbital soft tissue lesion abutting the nasal lacrimal duct, lateral and inferior to the globe, without definite osseous remodeling. there is no thickening of the lateral rectus muscle or inflammation. there is a moderate lateral displacement of the intraocular structures, but the globe is intact.
patient: oh, i see. whats the next step, doc?
doctor: we performed an anterior orbitotomy with biopsy 4 days after your presentation. the pathology was initially read as positive for intermediate grade epithelioid carcinoma, but after an outside consultation, the diagnosis was edited to epithelioid sarcoma with rhabdoid features proximal type.
patient: what does that mean, exactly?
doctor: immunohistochemical stains revealed the tumor to be ae1ae3 strong positive, gata3 strong positive, vimentin strong positive, ema focal positive, calponin focal positive, and a series of other markers were negative. this helps us better understand the nature of the tumor.
patient: considering my age and the tumors histology, what are my treatment options?
doctor: due to your age and the tumor histology, chemotherapy is not recommended by medical oncology. we completed your staging workup with a soft tissue neck ct, which showed no evidence of abnormal lymph nodes. additionally, a chestabdomenpelvis ct showed no evidence of metastatic disease in your chest, abdomen, or pelvis. thus, the disease is localized to the left orbit only.
patient: thats somewhat relieving. whats the plan moving forward?
doctor: we will closely monitor the lesion and discuss other treatment options with you as needed. its important to keep an eye on any changes and report them to us immediately.

doctor: i understand. were there any past history of hypertension, seizures, drug abuse, trauma, or infection before this incident?
patient: no, i never had any of those issues.
doctor: okay. on admission, our initial clinical examination showed you were unconscious with a gcs score of 1015, which corresponds to hunt  hess classification grade iv.
patient: oh, that sounds serious.
doctor: after we stabilized you, we performed a ct scan, which showed diffuse subarachnoid haemorrhage and a cisternal clot at the interpeduncular cistern. this is classified as modified fisher i. we also noticed moderate dilatation of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricle.
patient: what does that mean, exactly?
doctor: it means that you had bleeding in the space around your brain and a clot formed in a specific area. the dilatation of the temporal horns indicates some swelling in your brain. we then performed an angiography to further investigate the cause.
patient: and what did the angiography show?
doctor: the angiography revealed a ruptured saccular aneurysm of less than 3 mm in diameter, with a neck of 1.5 mm at the origin of your left frontopolar artery. considering the small size of the aneurysm and its ruptured nature, we decided to manage it conservatively.
patient: i see. but i heard that it bled again after 2 weeks?

doctor: it is a type of cancer, but dont worry. we will do our best to help you. we also performed a fetal ultrasound screening and it showed that your baby is developing normally.
patient: thats a relief. whats the plan for my treatment?
doctor: we decided not to perform a combined fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography fdg-petct scan before delivery due to the risk of radiation exposure during pregnancy. instead, we used ultrasound and whole-body mri wb-mri to stage the disease. it showed right cervical, bilateral supraclavicular, and mediastinal lymph node involvement without a bulky mass, indicating stage iia disease according to ann arbor classification.
patient: what does that mean?
doctor: it means the cancer is in the early stages and has not spread extensively. the multidisciplinary team, including haematologists, gynaecologists, radiologists, and neonatologists, decided to start chemotherapy only if clinically necessary. we have been following up with ultrasound, wb-mri, haematology consults, and gynaecological examinations. we also started therapy with steroid and paracetamol to slow down the progression of the disease and treat your itching and shoulder pain.
patient: hmm, okay. and hows my condition now?

patient: how did the surgery go?
doctor: the duration of the surgery was 549 minutes, and the blood loss was 863 ml. blood transfusion was not performed. we had to mobilize the pancreatic body more than usual for the pancreaticojejunostomy because it was a hard pancreas.
patient: what happened after the surgery?
doctor: on postoperative day 3, your liver function tests were still abnormal, and we found bloody fluids in the drain. an abdominal ct showed a characteristic hook-pattern on the anterior proximal celiac axis from compression of the mal, which had not been detected in the preoperative ct. ischemic changes in the remnant pancreas, hepatic lateral segment, and gastrojejunostomy site were also observed.
patient: oh no, what does that mean?
doctor: although all celiac branches were visible, there were almost no pulsations in those branches. we first tried interventional radiology, but the procedure failed due to tight compression against the outside of the celiac axis.

doctor: it means the mass may be affecting the muscles and tissues beneath the skin. we will need to conduct some laboratory investigations and a ct scan to get a clearer picture. 
patient: okay, lets do it.
after the tests
doctor: the laboratory results are within normal limits, and the ct scan revealed a contrast-enhancing lesion in the subcutaneous tissues, infiltrating the underlying musculoaponeurotic structures. this is highly suggestive of an abdominal wall endometrioma.
patient: so, whats the next step for me?
doctor: the best course of action would be surgical resection. we would remove the endometrioma along with a portion of the underlying aponeurosis and rectus abdominis muscle.
patient: and after that?
doctor: we will place a polypropylene mesh over the defect created by the resection and fix it to the anterior rectus sheath with nonabsorbable sutures. this will help to reinforce the area and promote healing.

doctor: alright. your triage vital signs show a temperature of 36.2c, blood pressure of 14090 mmhg, heart rate of 114, respiratory rate of 18, and an oxygen saturation of 96 on room air. the physical examination shows dry mucus membranes, regular heart rate without murmur, soft abdomen, and active hiccups. well give you a 1-liter bolus of intravenous normal saline and 25 mg of chlorpromazine thorazine by mouth to help with the hiccups.
patient: okay, thank you.
15-20 minutes later
doctor: im afraid weve encountered a serious issue. after receiving the chlorpromazine, you went into cardiac arrest. we initiated advanced cardiac life support acls interventions immediately. your initial rhythm was ventricular fibrillation, requiring four defibrillations at 200 joules each. we also observed torsades de pointes and administered 2 grams of intravenous magnesium.
patient: oh my, thats concerning.
doctor: yes, it is. your post-arrest ecgs show normal sinus rhythm with a rate of 98-99, but your qtc is between 495-521 ms, which is longer than the normal qtc of 440 ms in men. an arterial blood gas test showed metabolic acidosis with a ph of 7.22 normal range is 7.387.42, a lactate level of 14 mmoll normal range is 0.602.40, and an ionized calcium level of 1.12 mmoll normal range is 1.101.33. well need to perform a comprehensive metabolic panel to investigate further.
patient: i understand, please do whats necessary.
doctor: well keep you closely monitored and inform you of any updates. if you have any questions or concerns, please dont hesitate to ask.
patient: thank you, doctor. i really appreciate your help.","s: the patient, a known case of hypertension, diverticulosis, and bicuspid aortic valve with mild insufficiency, presents with persistent hiccups for one week and episodes of nonbloody, nonbilious emesis. he denies chest pain, abdominal pain, or dyspnea. he reports daily alcohol use and is not currently on any medications. no significant family medical history or history of palpitations, syncope, or seizures is reported.
o: initial vital signs include a temperature of 36.2c, blood pressure 14090 mmhg, heart rate 114 bpm, respiratory rate 18 bpm, and oxygen saturation 96 on room air. physical examination reveals dry mucus membranes, regular heart rate without murmur, soft abdomen, and active hiccups. after administration of 25 mg chlorpromazine for hiccups, the patient experienced cardiac arrest with initial rhythm of ventricular fibrillation, treated with four defibrillations and 2 grams of iv magnesium for observed torsades de pointes. post-arrest ecg shows normal sinus rhythm with a qtc of 495-521 ms. arterial blood gas indicates metabolic acidosis with a ph of 7.22, lactate 14 mmoll, and ionized calcium 1.12 mmoll.
a: the patients presentation is complicated by a cardiac arrest following chlorpromazine administration, likely exacerbated by underlying electrolyte imbalances and prolonged qtc. differential diagnoses include acute coronary syndrome, electrolyte disturbances, and complications from chronic alcohol use.
p: the patient will be closely monitored in the icu with continuous cardiac monitoring and electrolyte repletion. a comprehensive metabolic panel will be performed to further assess his condition. avoidance of qt-prolonging drugs and careful consideration of his alcohol use in management planning are recommended. further cardiology evaluation may be necessary depending on ongoing findings. education regarding the risks associated with alcohol use and its potential to exacerbate existing health issues will be provided.","s: the patient, a male with a history of hypertension, diverticulosis, a bicuspid aortic valve with mild insufficiency, presents with a one-week history of hiccups persisting for one week. he denies chest pain, abdominal pain, or dyspnea.

"doctor: hello, can you please tell me about your medical history, especially regarding alcohol and tobacco use?
patient: ive been using alcohol and tobacco extensively for many years.
doctor: i see. what brings you in today?
patient: for the past 2 months, ive had this progressively enlarging, painful ulcerative lesion in the middle of my tongue. its about 5 cm and has even caused an anterior tongue cleft. ive also had unintentional weight loss, left ear pain, and swelling under my jaw.
doctor: hmm, have you noticed any lumps in your neck area?
patient: yes, ive felt some non-tender lumps on both sides of my neck.
doctor: it seems you have bilateral palpable lymphadenopathy in levels i, ii, and iii. now, i understand youve had biopsies done before by an otolaryngologist. what were the results?
patient: they didnt find any cancer, but they saw some reactive inflammatory changes.
doctor: okay. we also conducted a positron emission tomography scan, which revealed hypermetabolic lesions in your anterior tongue and lymph nodes, suggesting malignancy. the assessment was a likely t34n2cm0 tongue squamous cell carcinoma. we performed a panendoscopy with biopsies and a physical examination under anesthesia for surgical planning. however, the biopsy results again did not show carcinoma but rather granulomatous inflammation without organisms present.
patient: so, whats the next step?
doctor: a multidisciplinary tumor board recommended a rheumatologic workup and an excisional lymph node biopsy. the lymph node biopsy results demonstrated noncaseating granulomatous inflammation with no malignancy, while laboratory results showed markedly elevated angiotensin converting enzyme ace levels. these findings suggested an atypical case of sarcoidosis, so we referred you for a pulmonary consultation.
patient: i remember that. i also developed some red spots on my extremities, palms, soles, and trunk.
doctor: yes, your laboratory evaluation demonstrated t pallidum immunoglobulin g antibodies present with a reflex rpr titer of 1:512. we then analyzed the lymph node biopsy sample with immunohistochemistry ihc, which revealed spirochetes. you were diagnosed with tertiary syphilis and started on doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 30 days due to a severe penicillin allergy.
patient: how am i doing after the treatment?
doctor: after receiving treatment, your tongue lesion is healing well, but there is still a persistent anterior tongue cleft. it is important for you to follow up with further laboratory evaluations to monitor your progress.
patient: alright, ill make sure to do that. thank you, doctor.","s: the patient, a long-term user of alcohol and tobacco, presents with a 2-month history of a progressively enlarging, painful ulcerative lesion in the middle of the tongue, measuring approximately 5 cm, associated with an anterior tongue cleft. the patient also reports unintentional weight loss, left ear pain, swelling under the jaw, and bilateral non-tender neck lumps.
o: physical examination revealed bilateral palpable lymphadenopathy in levels i, ii, and iii. positron emission tomography indicated hypermetabolic lesions in the anterior tongue and lymph nodes. initial biopsies suggested granulomatous inflammation without organisms, and further testing showed markedly elevated angiotensin converting enzyme levels. laboratory tests confirmed the presence of t pallidum immunoglobulin g antibodies with a reflex rpr titer of 1:512. immunohistochemistry on lymph node biopsy revealed spirochetes.
a: the primary diagnosis is tertiary syphilis, evidenced by serology and immunohistochemistry findings. differential diagnosis initially included tongue squamous cell carcinoma and sarcoidosis, but these were ruled out through biopsies and additional testing. the prognosis is good with appropriate treatment, though monitoring is necessary due to the persistent anterior tongue cleft and potential for relapse or incomplete resolution of symptoms.
p: the patient has been prescribed doxycycline 100 mg twice daily for 30 days due to severe penicillin allergy, with the treatment course already underway. follow-up includes further laboratory evaluations to monitor the resolution of syphilis and assess for any remaining or recurring symptoms. the patient has been referred for a pulmonary consultation to evaluate potential sarcoidosis and will continue to be monitored by a multidisciplinary team. education on the importance of compliance with the treatment regimen and follow-up appointments has been provided.","s: the patient, with a history of alcohol and tobacco use, presents with a progressively enlarging, painful ulcerative lesion in the middle of the tongue, which has caused unintentional weight loss, left ear pain, and swelling under the jaw.

"patient: hi doctor, ive been having some issues lately and im not sure whats going on.
doctor: im sorry to hear that. can you tell me more about your symptoms?
patient: well, ive been experiencing urinary frequency and nocturia for about a month now.
doctor: i see. lets discuss your medical history to better understand your situation. i know you have multiple psychiatric conditions, including bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and poor impulse control. what medications are you currently taking?
patient: im taking clonidine 0.1 mg three times daily, guanfacine 4 mg daily, bupropion sustained-release 150 mg daily, quetiapine 200 mg twice daily, and lithium 450 mg three times daily. i started lithium when i was 5 years old.
doctor: thank you for that information. about a year prior to your presentation, your lithium level was in the range of 0.91.1 mmoll and your serum creatinine was 0.78 mgdl, with an estimated glomerular filtration rate egfr of 86 mlmin1.73 m2 based on the bedside schwartz formula. well need to run some tests to identify any issues.
after running tests
doctor: your physical examination was unremarkable. urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.006, a ph of 6.0, but no hematuria or proteinuria. blood tests showed a lithium level of 1.4 mmoll, a tsh of 5.09 uiuml normal 0.554.78 uiuml, a calcium of 11.1 mgdl normal 8.610.6 mgdl, and a creatinine of 1.15 mgdl.
patient: is there anything we should do about it?
doctor: your primary care physician pcp reduced your lithium dose to 450 mg twice daily and initiated levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. one week later, your lithium level reduced to 1.1 mmoll. however, over the next couple of weeks, your creatinine increased to 1.3 mgdl.
patient: oh, that doesnt sound good.
doctor: your pcp decided to discontinue the lithium by tapering the dose over the next 3 weeks. despite a very low lithium level of 0.1 mmoll four weeks after discontinuation, your serum creatinine continued to increase, prompting a nephrology referral.
patient: so, what happens now?
doctor: at your presentation to the nephrology clinic, your physical examination was unremarkable. the nephrologist will further evaluate your condition and determine the best course of action for your treatment.
patient: thank you, doctor. i appreciate your help in figuring this out.","s: the patient reports experiencing urinary frequency and nocturia for about a month. the patient has a history of multiple psychiatric conditions including bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and poor impulse control. medications include clonidine 0.1 mg three times daily, guanfacine 4 mg daily, bupropion sustained-release 150 mg daily, quetiapine 200 mg twice daily, and lithium 450 mg three times daily, started at age 5.
