"S: The patient reported undergoing an ultrasound in April 2017, which identified a thyroid nodule in the left lobe. The patient underwent biochemical screening, including TSH, autoantibodies, and calcitonin levels, which showed elevated calcitonin. A stimulation test with intravenous calcium indicated significantly elevated calcitonin levels, leading to a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection. Post-surgery, the patient experienced transient hypocalcemia but recovered within 48 hours. The patient inquired about the recovery and results of the tissue tests post-surgery.
O: Ultrasound revealed a 1 cm thyroid nodule in the left lobe. Initial calcitonin level was 40 ngmL normal range 1-4.8 ngmL. Post-stimulation, calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ngmL. Postoperative recovery included slight hypocalcemia, resolving in 48 hours. Immunohistochemistry of the thyroid nodule confirmed medullary thyroid cancer MTC, 1 cm in size, with cells positive for calcitonin, Cromogranin A, Synaptofisin, and TTF-1, and negative for amyloid. No lymph node metastases were found. Additional tissue analysis involved antigen retrieval and immunolabeling confirming MTC.
A: The primary diagnosis is medullary thyroid cancer, confirmed by histological and immunohistochemical analysis of the thyroid nodule and absence of metastasis in lymph nodes. The patients elevated calcitonin levels and the results of the stimulation test supported the need for surgical intervention, which was successfully performed without complications.

[Doctor]: Hello, weve received your results from the ultrasound we performed in April 2017. It seems that there is a single thyroid nodule present in your left lobe, measuring 1 cm in its largest diameter. We also performed a complete biochemical screening, including tests for TSH, autoantibodies, and calcitonin.
[Patient]: Hmm, what did the screening results show, doctor?
[Doctor]: Your calcitonin level was found to be slightly elevated at 40 ngmL, which is above the normal range of 1-4.8 ngmL. To further investigate, we performed a stimulation test with intravenous calcium.
[Patient]: And what did the stimulation test show?
[Doctor]: After the stimulation, your calcitonin levels peaked at 1420 ngmL, which indicates that surgical treatment is necessary. As a result, you underwent a total thyroidectomy and central neck dissection on the side of the tumor.
[Patient]: Yes, I remember that. How was my recovery after the surgery?
[Doctor]: Your postoperative course was uneventful, with only a slight hypocalcemia recorded in the first day. However, it completely recovered 48 hours after the surgery, and you were discharged.
[Patient]: Thats good to hear. What did the tests on the removed tissue show?
[Doctor]: Immunohistochemistry performed on the thyroid nodule revealed the presence of a medullary thyroid cancer MTC measuring 1 cm. It is composed of cells with an eosinophilic cytoplasm and has a predominantly expansive growth pattern. A histological examination showed that the tumor cells were positive for calcitonin, Cromogranin A, Synaptofisin, and TTF-1, but negative for the presence of amyloid.

However, you mentioned experiencing nauseavomiting, elevated blood pressure, and restlessness 12 hours after discontinuation. Is that correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats right. It was pretty uncomfortable.
[Doctor]: I apologize for the discomfort. To alleviate these symptoms, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion at 240 gday, and the symptoms disappeared. However, restlessness occurred each time the dose was reduced, so we decided to initiate a transdermal fentanyl patch to taper the opioid more slowly. How has that been working for you?
[Patient]: The patch has been helpful Ive noticed a difference.
[Doctor]: Good to hear. Unfortunately, your pancreatitis with abdominal pain recurred transiently one month later. Therefore, we resumed the continuous intravenous fentanyl infusion and titrated it to 600 gday. We have been gradually decreasing the dose daily 600, 300, 240, 180, 120, and 60 gday. As your pancreatitis has improved, we were able to discontinue the fentanyl without causing withdrawal symptoms.

Hmm, I can see a well-defined 3.5  3  2 cm-sized solid, spherical submucosal nodule adjacent to the sublingual gland. Its covered with light bluish smooth mucus. Do you feel any pain when I apply pressure to the tumor?
[Patient]: Yes, I feel slight pain when you press on it.
[Doctor]: Alright. Your tongues mobility and sensory functions seem to be normal, and I dont detect any lymphadenopathy in the submandibular region on palpation. Well need to conduct some laboratory tests and an enhanced computed tomography scan to get a clearer picture of the issue.
[Patient]: Okay, I understand.
After the tests
[Doctor]: Your lab results are all normal, and the enhanced computed tomography scan revealed a 2.8  1.8  2.1 cm-sized well-defined, solid, heterogeneous nodule that doesnt appear to involve the mandible. We also found a nodular lesion occupying the left floor of the mouth with abundant blood flow. No enlarged lymph nodes were detected in the submental or submandibular regions.
[Patient]: So, what does that mean, doctor?
[Doctor]: Based on these findings, our initial clinical impression is that this could be a benign salivary gland tumor, dermoid cyst, or benign connective tissue neoplasm. We will need to schedule you for surgery via an intraoral approach to remove the tumor and further examine it.
[Patient]: Alright, so what will the surgery involve?
[Doctor]: During the surgery, well make an elliptical incision around the periphery of the sublingual gland, and prepare a full-thickness tissue flap along the lingual aspect of the sublingual gland. After freeing the sublingual gland from its surrounding tissue, well find the well-circumscribed tumor without capsular extension beneath the body of the sublingual gland.

There was also a slight increase in the CT value due to surrounding panniculitis, as shown in Fig.
[Patient]: Oh, I see. So what does that mean for me?
[Doctor]: We also conducted an MRCP, which showed that your cystic duct is connected to an aberrant bile duct. Based on these findings, you were diagnosed with chronic calculous cholecystitis with aberrant bile duct flow into the cystic duct.
[Patient]: Okay, so whats the next step for treatment?
[Doctor]: We performed a laparoscopic cholecystectomy to address the issue. During the procedure, we placed four ports: a 12-mm camera port in the umbilical area, a 12-mm port in the epigastric area, a 5-mm port in the right subcostal area, and a 5-mm port at the right lateral abdomen.
[Patient]: How did the surgery go?
[Doctor]: Due to the inflammatory fibrotic adhesion in Calots triangle, the aberrant right hepatic duct ARHD was excessively exposed. We used a fundus-first technique to confirm the ARHD after exposing the inner layer of the subserosal layer at the dorsal and ventral side of Calots triangle. We confirmed that the ARHD drained into the cystic duct.
[Patient]: Was there any need to preserve the ARHD?
[Doctor]: Preoperative MRCP suggested that it was not necessary to preserve the ARHD, as it seemed to be closed at the hepatic side without communicating with the major right branch of the intrahepatic bile duct.

[Doctor]: Hello, I received your medical records. Youre a 50-year-old African American female, and you presented with a three-week history of intractable headache, confusion, vertical binocular diplopia, photophobia, and difficulty with balance, correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats right. These symptoms have been bothering me for a while now.
[Doctor]: I see. During the examination, your best corrected visual acuities were 2025 in the right eye and 2020 in the left eye. Your intraocular pressures were 14 mmHg in both eyes, and no afferent pupillary defect was noted. Your extraocular motility and confrontational visual fields were full in both eyes. Is that correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats what they told me.
[Doctor]: The anterior segment examination in both eyes was unremarkable. However, the funduscopic examination revealed grade-four optic disc edema, blurring of the optic disc margin, and obscuration of vasculature of the optic nerve. Preretinal and intraretinal hemorrhages were present in both eyes, mainly in the peripapillary retina but also extending to the mid-peripheral retina. Are you following so far?
[Patient]: Yes, I understand.
[Doctor]: Optic nerve swelling was confirmed on optical coherence tomography OCT of the retinal nerve fiber layer. Fluorescein angiography revealed hyperfluorescence of the optic disc in both eyes. 
[Patient]: Okay, what does that mean for me?
[Doctor]: We also performed computed tomography of the head, magnetic resonance imaging of the brain, and magnetic resonance venography of the brain. These tests were unremarkable and showed no evidence of intracranial mass, hemorrhage, or ischemia.
[Patient]: Thats good news, right?
[Doctor]: Yes, its good that we didnt find any of those issues. Moving on to the cerebrospinal fluid CSF analysis, it revealed an opening pressure of 30 cm H2O, 77 white blood cellsmm3 with 94 lymphocytes, 93 mgdL protein, and 73 mgdL glucose.

[Doctor]: Hello, I see that you are a 53-year-old woman with a posterior, stage IIB NSCLC in the left upper lobe. Youve received neoadjuvant carboplatin, pemetrexed, and radiotherapy already. Can you tell me if youve been experiencing any discomfort or new symptoms recently?
[Patient]: Yeah, doctor. Ive been having severe left back pain and left axillary numbness and paresthesia.
[Doctor]: I see. Based on your symptoms, we conducted some tests and found that the tumor has attached to the T2 and T3 vertebrae and infiltrated the corresponding nerve roots. This is likely the cause of your complaints. We consulted the neurosurgery and thoracic surgery services to discuss the best management for your condition.
[Patient]: What did they recommend, doctor?
[Doctor]: The magnetic resonance imaging MRI studies showed that there was no direct tumor invasion of the left brachial plexus or subclavian vessels. After discussing different treatment options, they recommended a posterior approach, image-guided T2 and T3 osteotomy followed by transthoracic en bloc resection of the thoracic tumor.
[Patient]: Will that help with the pain and numbness?
[Doctor]: Yes, the operation aims to address the issues caused by the tumor attachment and infiltration. Youll need to give your informed consent for the procedure.
[Patient]: Alright, I agree to the operation.
[Doctor]: Great. During the operation, well make an initial incision in the operating room and expose the spinal processes, lamina, and transverse processes from T1 through T5 as well as 5 cm of the ribs from the left costovertebral junction on the side of the tumor. Well then take images with the O-Arm and register your spine to the StealthStation navigation suite using a stereotactic probe.
[Patient]: What happens next?
[Doctor]: Well use spine navigation to place the instrumentation at the level above and below the tumor-infiltrated vertebrae. We wont place screws on the left T2 and T3 vertebrae. The spinous processes and lamina of T2 and T3 will be removed, and the nerve roots will be exposed on the left side.
[Patient]: And then youll remove the tumor?

"S: The patient is a 70-year-old woman who presented with chest distress lasting 11 hours, shortness of breath at rest, and difficulty lying in the recumbent position. She has a history of hypertension and diabetes mellitus, for which she takes oral medications. She reports relief of initial symptoms post coronary angiography and stent implantation but developed hematochezia on the third day post-operation without abdominal pain.
O: Initial examination post-admission led to a diagnosis of coronary atherosclerotic heart disease. Treatment included coronary angiography, stent implantation, and administration of heparin 2000 units arterial intrathecal and 3500 units intravenous. Post-procedure medications were aspirin 100 mgday, TiGraylo 90 mg every 12 hours, and enoxaparin sodium 0.4 mL every 12 hours subcutaneously for 3 days. On the third day post-operation, the patient developed hematochezia. Examination revealed mild abdominal tenderness in the left lower quadrant, peritoneal irritation signs, and a neoplasm-like mucous clot in the anus. Lab tests showed hemoglobin at 102 gL normal: 120-160 gL, prothrombin time 13.4 s normal: 11-13.5 s, and INR 1.2. Colonoscopy identified a submucosal mass in the sigmoid colon with a partially ruptured mucous membrane. Abdominal CT scan confirmed a submucosal hematoma in the sigmoid colon and thickening at the left flexure of the colon.
A: The primary diagnosis is coronary atherosclerotic heart disease, complicated by post-operative hematochezia likely due to anticoagulation therapy. Differential diagnosis includes gastrointestinal neoplasm versus hematoma secondary to anticoagulation. The prognosis depends on the management of the gastrointestinal complications and the underlying heart disease.
P: The initial management included discontinuation of anticoagulants, administration of total parenteral nutrition, and close monitoring. Given the lack of resolution of clinical symptoms with conservative treatment, further evaluation and possible intervention for the sigmoid colon issue are planned. Continued cardiovascular management with adjustments to anticoagulation therapy will be necessary, considering the gastrointestinal risks. Patient education regarding signs of gastrointestinal bleeding and the importance of follow-up appointments will be emphasized. Referral to gastroenterology for further assessment and management of the sigmoid colon condition is indicated.","Summarize the following medical dialogue into a SOAP note:

[Doctor]: After the angiography, we prescribed you aspirin 100 mg per day, TiGraylo 90 mg once every 12 h, and enoxaparin sodium 0.4 mL once every 12 h subcutaneously for 3 days. Your chest distress and shortness of breath had relieved. However, on the third day after the operation, you were diagnosed with hematochezia without abdominal pain.
[Patient]: Oh, I see.
[Doctor]: During the physical examination, we found mild abdominal tenderness, especially in your left lower quadrant, and some signs indicative of peritoneal irritation. There was also a neoplasm-like mucous clot connected to your bowel in the anus. We conducted some laboratory tests which showed declined levels of hemoglobin 102 gL, prolonged prothrombin time 13.4 s, and an international normalized ratio of 1.2.
[Patient]: What does that mean?
[Doctor]: These results indicate some issues with your blood clotting. Moving on, we performed a colonoscopy and found a submucosal mass in your sigmoid colon, covered with a partially ruptured mucous membrane and some clots in the cavity, causing obstruction. An abdominal CT scan showed a submucosal hematoma in the sigmoid colon, and the density of the mass did not significantly change on an enhanced CT scan. The left flexure of the colon was also thick, which could be another hematoma.

[Doctor]: Hello, I wanted to discuss your current situation and review your surgical history with you. Can you tell me what brought you to our facility initially?
[Patient]: Yes, I came in with a strangulated large bowel and ventral hernia, 10 years after my LAGB procedure.
[Doctor]: Thats correct. At that time, you were still morbidly obese and had been lost to follow-up. We performed an emergency surgical hernia repair, which included resection of the necrotic transverse colon, and created a loop ileostomy. One year later, you presented with a LAGB port-site infection. Do you remember what we did during that time?
[Patient]: Yes, you removed the port and sutured the tubing to my abdominal wall.
[Doctor]: Exactly. During both admissions, we observed the LAGB tubing in a stable position adjacent to the transverse colon on the CT scans, with no concerns for penetration. Six months after the port-site infection, we elected to reverse the ileostomy. However, there were complications in the early post-operative period. Can you tell me about those symptoms?
[Patient]: I remember feeling really sick and ended up having abdominal sepsis.
[Doctor]: Yes, thats correct. The abdominal CT demonstrated transection of the remaining proximal transverse colon by the LAGB tubing. Due to this, we had to perform a right hemicolectomy, which involved the removal of the gastric band and tubing, and we created an end ileostomy. 
[Patient]: Oh, I see. So, whats the plan moving forward, doctor?
[Doctor]: Our main focus now is to ensure proper healing and monitor for any complications. Well keep a close eye on your progress and address any issues that may arise.

[Doctor]: Hi there, I understand you originally had a laparoscopic adjustable gastric band 4 years ago. What brings you to the bariatric surgery clinic today?
[Patient]: Yeah, thats right. Lately, Ive had trouble tolerating solid foods.
[Doctor]: I see. We did a work-up and found that your gastric band is still in good position, but you have oesophagitis and gastritis, causing swelling of the mucosa at the band site. We removed the fluid from the reservoir and treated you conservatively with anti-reflux medication and a full liquid diet. How have your symptoms been after 2 weeks of treatment?
[Patient]: Theyve improved a lot, thanks
[Doctor]: Im glad to hear that. After careful consideration, you decided to undergo revisional surgery to convert the laparoscopic adjustable gastric band to a laparoscopic vertical sleeve gastrectomy. You went through the appropriate multidisciplinary team and were found to be a suitable candidate for surgery. The surgery went well, and there were no complications. You were discharged on post-operative day 3. How have you been feeling since then?
[Patient]: Ive been okay, but on post-operative day 12, I started feeling lightheaded and short of breath, so I went to the hospital.
[Doctor]: Yes, you were readmitted to an outside tertiary care hospital and found to have leukocytosis, with a high white blood cell count of 18,000 cells l1. A CT scan with intravenous contrast was performed, and you were diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism. You were immediately transferred to our center for definitive care.
[Patient]: Thats right, and when I arrived here, you all reviewed my CT films.
[Doctor]: Yes, our radiologists noticed there was air and a faint suggestion of oral contrast outside of the suture line. Given this finding, we ordered an upper gastrointestinal UGI evaluation. During the early phase, no leak was observed, partly due to the slow passage of 30 ml oral non-ionic contrast.
[Patient]: Oh, I see.
[Doctor]: Some residual contrast from the outside hospital CT was present in the transverse and descending colon. Only after delayed imaging and administration of additional non-ionic contrast were we able to determine the situation more accurately.
[Patient]: So, whats the next step, then?
[Doctor]: We will continue to monitor your conditionS: The patient, who previously underwent laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding 4 years ago, reports difficulty tolerating solid foods. Symptoms of oesophagitis and gastritis at the band site have improved with conservative treatment, including anti-reflux medication and a full liquid diet. However, the patient experienced lightheadedness and shortness of breath on post-operative day 12, leading to hospital readmission and diagnosis of a pulmonary embolism.
O: Initial work-up showed the gastric band in good position with oesophagitis and gastritis, treated conservatively. Post-operative day 3, the patient was discharged. On readmission, leukocytosis was noted with a white blood cell count of 18,000 cells l1. CT scan revealed a pulmonary embolism. Upper gastrointestinal evaluation showed no initial leak, but delayed imaging and additional contrast administration confirmed a leak at the suture line of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy.
A: The primary diagnosis is a leak at the suture line of the vertical sleeve gastrectomy, complicated by a pulmonary embolism. Differential diagnoses could include other sources of gastrointestinal bleeding or obstruction, but these are less likely given the imaging findings and clinical presentation.

There are no obvious blood signals or calcification in this area. Unfortunately, its difficult to characterize or classify the mass using traditional ultrasound methods.
[Patient]: Oh, I see. So, what does that mean for me, doctor?
[Doctor]: Based on the ultrasound findings, we can confirm that there is a mass located close to the bone. However, due to the limitations of the ultrasound, we cannot precisely determine the nature of the mass. We have included these findings in our ultrasound diagnostic report.
[Patient]: Hmm, so whats the next step?
[Doctor]: The next step would be a more detailed examination, such as an MRI or a biopsy, to better understand the nature of the mass and determine the appropriate treatment options.
[Patient]: Okay, when can we schedule that?
[Doctor]: Ill have my assistant schedule the MRI or biopsy for you as soon as possible. In the meantime, please monitor any changes in the mass or if you experience any discomfort or pain.
[Patient]: Alright, thank you, doctor.

Please dont hesitate to contact us if you have any concerns or questions in the meantime.S: The patient is a 48-year-old woman who reports noticing a palpable mass in the distal phalanx of her left ring finger. She has a history of enchondroma in the same location.
O: Ultrasound examination revealed an exophytic hypoechoic mass in the distal phalanx of the left ring finger, connected to the medullary cavity through the interrupted bone cortex, with no obvious blood signals or calcification. The mass is difficult to characterize or classify using traditional ultrasound methods.
A: The ultrasound findings suggest the presence of a mass near the bone, but the nature of the mass cannot be precisely determined due to the limitations of the ultrasound. Further evaluation with MRI or biopsy is necessary to clarify the nature of the mass and determine appropriate treatment options.
P: Plan to schedule an MRI or biopsy as soon as possible to further evaluate the nature of the mass. The patient is advised to monitor any changes in the mass and report any discomfort or pain. Contact the clinic if any concerns arise."
"S: Patient reports recurrent amnesia upon waking with disorientation and repetitive questioning, lasting a few minutes. Additionally, experiences 30-second trance-like episodes during the day, sometimes with repetitive swallowing movements, followed by disorientation and repetitive questioning, occurring in clusters of up to seven per day. Patient has partial recollection of these episodes. Reports loss of newly acquired memories, difficulty recalling autobiographical events, and familiar routes. Also experiences olfactory hallucinations smelling like candy floss, blunted sense of smell, headaches with migrainous features, postural arm tremor, tingling in legs, malaise, and low mood. Medical history includes depression and heavy alcohol use.
O: Brain MRI showed subtly increased T2 signal in the right hippocampus. EEG was normal. Clinical examination revealed no focal neurological signs. Patient has been on lamotrigine, starting at 25 mg and increased to 100 mg twice a day, which resolved the trance-like and amnestic attacks. Other symptoms persist.
A: Primary diagnosis of Transient Epileptic Amnesia TEA based on clinical presentation and response to lamotrigine. Differential diagnoses could include other forms of epilepsy, transient ischemic attacks, or psychological factors contributing to memory loss. The prognosis is generally favorable with appropriate management of epilepsy, but ongoing monitoring is required due to the complexity of symptoms.

[Doctor]: Your ultrasound results show findings consistent with acute complicated appendicitis. Because of this, we will start you on intravenous antimicrobial treatment, which includes cefotaxime and metronidazole. Well also need to take you to the operating room for a laparoscopic appendectomy.
[Patient]: Oh, okay. What does the surgery involve?
[Doctor]: A laparoscopic appendectomy is a minimally invasive surgery to remove your inflamed appendix. Well make a few small incisions in your abdomen, insert a laparoscope to view the area, and then remove the appendix.
[Patient]: Will you test the fluid in my abdomen too?
[Doctor]: Yes, we will take a fluid culture during the surgery to identify any bacteria that may be present.
After the surgery
[Doctor]: The surgery went well, and we were able to remove your inflamed appendix. The fluid culture revealed the presence of P. aeruginosa, Str. viridans, and Gemella morbillorum bacteria. We will continue your antibiotic treatment to ensure a full recovery.

[Patient]: Hi, Doctor. Ive been having a fever, headache, and vomiting for about a month now.
[Doctor]: I see. We performed a Magnetic Resonance Imaging MRI of your brain and it showed multiple varying sizes of ring-enhancing lesions scattered in both cerebral and cerebellar hemispheres. This suggests either a metastatic brain tumour or an infection. We also did a Computer Tomographic CT scan of your thorax and found a 6.5 cm x 4.5 cm mass in the right upper lobe, which is suspicious for primary lung malignancy.
[Patient]: Oh no, that sounds serious.
[Doctor]: Yes, we needed to investigate further. Your blood tests showed mild leucocytosis of 11.7 x 103uL and a normal C-reactive protein of 1.5 mgL. We also performed a lumbar puncture to check your cerebrospinal fluid CSF. It demonstrated raised intracranial pressure of 26 cm H2O, elevated cell count of 260 cellsmm3 with 90 lymphocyte predominance, low glucose of 1.9 mmolL, and raised protein at 1.15 gL.
[Patient]: What do those numbers mean, Doctor?
[Doctor]: These results indicate an infection. Initial mucicarmine and India Ink staining did not demonstrate organisms, but further tests detected CSF cryptococcal antigen, and CSF fungal culture grew C. gattii. Your blood cryptococcal antigen was also detected at a titre of 1:1280. Importantly, your human immunodeficiency virus testing came back negative.
[Patient]: So, its an infection, not a tumor?
[Doctor]: Thats correct. We performed a bronchoscopy to further evaluate the right upper lobe mass. The bronchoalveolar lavage showed thick-walled fungal yeast forms with narrow-based budding, consistent with Cryptococcus yeasts. These were highlighted by mucicarmine special stain. The bronchoscopic biopsies showed non-specific chronic inflammatory infiltrates in the bronchial wall epithelium and lung parenchyma.

[Patient]: Hi, Doctor. Im a 65-year-old man and Ive been experiencing reduced vision in both my eyes lately.
[Doctor]: I see. Can you tell me about your medical history? Have you had any conditions or treatments in the past?
[Patient]: Yes, I was treated for small cell cancer of the lung and had chemotherapy for it. Seven months ago, I had breathlessness and a pleural effusion was found during a routine examination. They also discovered a mycobacterial infection in the pleura.
[Doctor]: It looks like you were treated with rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and INH for the mycobacterial infection. Is that correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats right. But I had drug-induced hepatitis, so they changed my regimen to rifampicin and ethambutol with the addition of levofloxacin.
[Doctor]: Alright, lets start by examining your eyes. First, well check your best-corrected visual acuity, which is 615 in both eyes. Your extraocular movements and anterior segment examination seem normal. Now, Ill perform a dilated fundus examination. That looks normal as well.
[Patient]: So, what could be causing my reduced vision?
[Doctor]: Lets conduct a visual-evoked potential VEP test to get a better understanding of your condition. The VEP results show reduced amplitude and prolonged latency in both eyes, suggestive of bilateral optic axonopathy.
[Patient]: What does that mean?
[Doctor]: It means there might be some damage to the optic nerves in both your eyes. To further investigate this, well need to do an MRI scan.
[Patient]: Okay, what did the MRI scan show?
[Doctor]: The MRI scan revealed multiple round peripherally enhancing lesions in both cerebral hemispheres and in the right cerebellum. Moreover, Central 30-2 perimetry revealed an incomplete left homonymous hemianopia with additional inferior temporal defects in the right eye.
[Patient]: Is it related to the medications Ive been taking?
[Doctor]: Yes, based on these findings, it seems that ethambutol toxicity is the likely cause of your reduced vision, as the lesions in the cerebral hemispheres are not consistent with the perimetric findings.
[Patient]: What should I do now? Are there any treatment options?
[S: The patient is a 65-year-old male presenting with reduced vision in both eyes. He has a history of small cell lung cancer treated with chemotherapy and a subsequent mycobacterial infection for which he was treated with rifampicin, ethambutol, pyrazinamide, and INH.

A: The patient presents with severe congenital motor and sensory neuropathy, likely Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, given the chronicity, pattern of motor and sensory deficits, and diagnostic findings. Differential diagnoses may include other forms of hereditary neuropathies or motor neuron diseases, but these are less likely given the clinical and electrophysiological findings.
P: Continue use of mobility aids and initiate referral to a neurologist specialized in neuromuscular disorders for further evaluation and management. Physical therapy to maintain mobility and prevent complications is recommended. Occupational therapy consultation for assistance with activities of daily living, particularly those requiring fine motor skills. Regular follow-up to monitor progression of symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary. Patient education regarding the nature of the disease and genetic counseling may be beneficial for family planning.","Summarize the following medical dialogue into a SOAP note:
[Doctor]: Hi, how can I help you today?
[Patient]: Well, Ive been severely affected by some mobility and balance issues since I was a kid.
[Doctor]: I see. Can you tell me when you first started to notice these difficulties?
[Patient]: My parents first noticed my mobility and balance difficulties when I was around 2 years and 7 months old. I started walking independently at 8 months, but I could never ride a bicycle.
[Doctor]: Hmm, that must have been challenging. Have you experienced any problems with activities that require fine motor skills, like using your hands?
[Patient]: Yes, Ive always had significant problems with fine motor activity of both hands. Since childhood, Ive been unable to cut food by myself.
[Doctor]: I understand. What kind of mobility aids do you use to help you get around?
[Patient]: I require a pedestal walker and long leg braces to ambulate.
[Doctor]: Okay. Have you noticed any changes in your voice over the years?
[Patient]: My voice has been hoarse since I was 16, and I have documented vocal cord paralysis. I also develop shortness of breath after speaking for several minutes.
[Doctor]: I see. Let me conduct a neurological examination to better understand your condition. After the examination I found some weakness in your biceps and triceps muscles in your upper extremities and no movements in your intrinsic hand muscles, wrist extensors, or wrist flexors. In your lower extremities, there are trace movements of your hamstrings and no movements of your quadriceps, anterior tibialis, gastrocnemius, or intrinsic foot muscles.
[Patient]: Oh, that sounds bad...
[Doctor]: Your small fiber sensory modalities, like pin prick or light touch, are essentially normal, with only a mild decrease to pin prick on your right great toe. However, your large fiber sensory modalities are profoundly abnormal. You were unable to detect vibration with a Rydell tuning fork at your toes, ankles, knees, and fingers. Joint position was absent at your toes and left ankle, and reduced at both knees.
[Patient]: I had no idea it was that extensive.
[Doctor]: Your Compound muscle action potential CMAP and sensory nerve action potential SNAP amplitudes were unobtainable, except for a markedly reduced axillar nerve CMAP. Based on these findings, your CMT Neuropathy score is in the severe range ofS: The patient reports severe mobility and balance issues since childhood, starting at age 2 years and 7 months. The patient was able to walk independently at 8 months but never learned to ride a bicycle. Fine motor skills, including the ability to cut food independently, have been significantly impaired since childhood. The patient also experiences hoarseness and shortness of breath after speaking for several minutes, attributed to vocal cord paralysis.

"S: The patient reports a high voltage electrical burn on the scalp treated with dressing for 10 days at another hospital. He now presents with a fever and an infected wound on the scalp. He denies any history of immune compromise.
O: The patient exhibits signs of a potentially infected and gangrenous scalp wound. Planned interventions include scalp debridement, clinical examination for hyphae and gangrenous changes, and a tissue biopsy for histopathology to confirm the presence of A. corymbifera. Initial treatment with intravenous amphotericin B is noted.
A: The primary diagnosis is an invasive fungal infection, likely zygomycosis, secondary to a high voltage electrical burn with subsequent wound infection. Differential diagnosis includes other types of fungal infections affecting immunocompetent individuals. The prognosis depends on the response to antifungal treatment and surgical management.
P: Immediate management includes surgical debridement of the scalp and administration of intravenous amphotericin B for a total of 6 weeks. A tissue biopsy will be conducted during the debridement to identify the specific fungal pathogen. Post-debridement, the patient will undergo a clinical examination two days later to assess for further fungal growth and tissue viability. If the infection resolves, a free anterior lateral thigh flap will be used to cover the scalp defect, with recipient vessels being the superior temporal artery and vein. Continuous monitoring and follow-up are essential to ensure the effectiveness of the treatment and manage any complications.","Summarize the following medical dialogue into a SOAP note:

[Doctor]: I see. Do you have any history of immune compromise?
[Patient]: No, I dont.
[Doctor]: Alright. Well have to do a debridement of your scalp to remove the infected tissue. Unfortunately, even after the debridement, you may still have a sustained fever and raised counts.
[Patient]: Oh, okay.
[Doctor]: Two days after the debridement, well do a clinical examination. We might find hyphae over the wound margin and gangrenous changes over your scalp surrounding the wound.
[Patient]: That sounds serious.
[Doctor]: Yes, this could be an invasive fungal infection called zygomycosis. Well start you on an injection of amphotericin B and take you for a wide debridement. Well also take a tissue biopsy for histopathology examination.
[Patient]: Alright.
[Doctor]: During the procedure, well perform outer bony cortex chiseling with a high-speed diamond burr. The histopathology report will help us identify the specific fungus causing the infection, which in your case is A. corymbifera. Intravenous amphotericin B injection will be continued for a 4-week period since diagnosis to complete healing.
[Patient]: Okay, I understand.
[Doctor]: After two weeks of anti-fungal treatment, your clinical condition should improve. Once we confirm the absence of the fungal infection, well cover the scalp defect with a free anterior lateral thigh flap.

"S: The patient, with a history of hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus, was admitted for an open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture and received unfractionated heparin for DVT prophylaxis. On the fourth day post-operation, the patient developed acute shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxemia, leading to a diagnosis of DVT and a subocclusive saddle-shaped pulmonary embolism. The following day, the patient experienced sudden left-sided weakness and rightward gaze deviation, indicative of an acute ischemic stroke. The patient reports these symptoms were confirmed by CT angiogram and MRI, showing right-sided common carotid artery occlusion and a tandem occlusion of the inferior branch of the right middle cerebral artery.
O: Initial platelet count was 153,000L, which dropped to 94,000L post-thrombectomy, raising suspicion for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia HIT. However, PF4-H AB and SRA tests were negative, and platelet count improved to 105,000L. The patient was restarted on a therapeutic continuous heparin infusion. A transthoracic echocardiogram with a bubble study revealed a patent foramen ovale with right to left shunting, suggesting a paradoxical embolism as the cause of the stroke. The patients platelet count later downtrended to 36,000L.
A: The primary diagnosis is acute ischemic stroke secondary to a paradoxical embolism through a patent foramen ovale, complicated by a pulmonary embolism and DVT. Differential diagnosis included HIT, which was ruled out with negative PF4-H AB and SRA tests. The patients fluctuating platelet count remains a concern for ongoing monitoring.
P: Continue monitoring the platelet count and adjust anticoagulation therapy as necessary. Maintain therapeutic heparin infusion while monitoring for any signs of bleeding or thrombocytopenia. Consider consultation with a hematologist for platelet management and a cardiologist for evaluation of the patent foramen ovale. Educate the patient on the signs of stroke recurrence and the importance of adhering to the anticoagulation therapy regimen. Schedule follow-up appointments for continuous assessment and management of the patients complex conditions.","Summarize the following medical dialogue into a SOAP note:
[Doctor]: Hello there, I see you have a history of hypertension and well-controlled type 2 diabetes mellitus. What brings you here today?
[Patient]: Well, I was admitted to the hospital after an open reduction and internal fixation of an ankle fracture. I was treated with unfractionated heparin for deep vein thrombosis prophylaxis.
[Doctor]: I understand. How have you been feeling since then?
[Patient]: On the fourth day, I developed acute shortness of breath, tachycardia, and hypoxemia. The doctors did a DVT and pulmonary embolism workup.
[Doctor]: And what did they find?
[Patient]: They found both a DVT and a subocclusive saddle-shaped pulmonary embolism. They started me on a continuous heparin infusion for treatment.
[Doctor]: I see. Did you experience any other symptoms after that?
[Patient]: Yes, the following day, I developed sudden left-sided weakness and rightward gaze deviation.
[Doctor]: That sounds concerning. It seems like you had an acute ischemic stroke. Did they perform any imaging tests to confirm this?
[Patient]: Yes, they did a CT angiogram of the head and neck and an MRI of my brain. They found that the stroke was caused by right-sided common carotid artery occlusion with thrombus extending into the external and internal carotid arteries.
[Doctor]: Did they find anything else on the imaging?
[Patient]: They also noted a tandem occlusion of the inferior branch of the right middle cerebral artery on cerebral angiography.
[Doctor]: So, what was the next step in your treatment?
[Patient]: The doctors performed a successful mechanical thrombectomy of the right carotid artery bifurcation thrombus.
[Doctor]: Thats great to hear. How did your platelet count look after the procedure?
[Patient]: My platelet count dropped from 153,000L to 94,000L, which raised suspicion for heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. They stopped the heparin infusion and started me on continuous bivalirudin infusion instead.
[Doctor]: Did they perform any additional tests to confirm the suspicion of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia?
[Patient]: Yes, they sent PF4-H AB and SRA tests.

[Patient]: No, Ive been healthy and developing normally.
[Doctor]: Alright. At presentation, you did not have diencephalic syndrome. We conducted a brain MRI which demonstrated the presence of a large lobulated multicompartmental supra-sellar mass, centered within the hypothalamusoptic chiasm, measuring 5.4cm x 3.4cm x 5cm. This mass has some effect on the midbrain and third ventricle, causing obstructive hydrocephalus.
[Patient]: Oh no, that sounds serious.
[Doctor]: Yes, it is a serious condition. We performed an endoscopic biopsy and septostomy, along with a right-sided ventriculoperitoneal VP shunt to manage your hydrocephalus. The pathology of the lesion confirmed the diagnosis of a low-grade glioma. It was BRAF-V600E negative on immunohistochemistry but positive on next-generation sequencing.

[Doctor]: I see. Lets start with a physical examination. After the examination Your blood pressure is increased, and your oxygen saturation is low. I also noticed some bilateral basal pulmonary end-inspiratory rales upon auscultation of your chest.
[Patient]: Oh, that doesnt sound good.
[Doctor]: Well need to perform an electrocardiography ECG to check for any myocardial injury pattern. After the ECG The ECG results do not demonstrate an acute myocardial injury pattern, which is a good sign.
[Patient]: Thats a relief.
[Doctor]: We also took a chest radiography, which showed bilateral diffuse infiltrations, Kerley B lines, and flow inversion. Furthermore, we tested your cardiac serum markers high-sensitivity troponin I using Architect STAT assay by Abbott Diagnostics and performed a D-dimer test, both of which came back negative.
[Patient]: Okay.
[Doctor]: We also conducted an echocardiographic assessment which disclosed mild concentric hypertrophy, mildly impaired left ventricular systolic function without regional wall motion abnormalities, and moderate diastolic dysfunction with elevated filling pressure. Based on all this information, we have diagnosed you with acute pulmonary edema.
[Patient]: Oh no, what does that mean?
[Doctor]: It means fluid has built up in your lungs, making it difficult for you to breathe. We will need to hospitalize you under closed monitoring in the intensive care unit to treat this condition.
[Patient]: Alright.
[Doctor]: We will administer furosemide and glyceryl trinitrate intravenously and an angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitor orally, in combination with oxygen support. This should help subside your acute heart failure symptoms.
[Patient]: How long will it take for me to recover?
[Doctor]: Complete respiratory recovery should occur in approximately 12 hours. During the second day of hospitalization, we will perform another ECG to check for any T-wave inversion. If needed, you will also undergo coronary angiography to rule out significant coronary artery disease.
[Patient]: I understand.
[Doctor]: Keep in mind that there are other possible causes of T-wave inversion, such as myocardial ischemia, subarachnoidS: The patient presented to the emergency department with complaints of extreme breathlessness and profuse diaphoresis for the last 2 hours.

[Doctor]: Hello, how can I help you today?
[Patient]: Hi, Ive been experiencing some issues with my left eye. I noticed a thickening of the iris, and its been bothering me.
[Doctor]: I see. Lets perform a gonioscopy to take a closer look at the root of the iris in your left eye. 
After performing the gonioscopy
[Doctor]: The gonioscopy revealed a pigmented fusiform thickening of the iris root in your left eye. We also did an ultrasound biomicroscopy UBM which showed the presence of a well-circumscribed dome-shaped mass at the level of the ciliary body, between the 2:30 and 3 oclock positions. The lesion is 8.18 mm large, 7.74 mm long, and 4.88 mm thick. It appears to be a melanoma of the ciliary body, involving the adjacent iris root.
[Patient]: Oh no, that sounds serious. Whats the next step?
[Doctor]: In July 2008, you underwent brachytherapy using 106Ru. You received 100 Gy at the apex, with a dose rate of 79.09 cGyhr, and a total rate at the sclera of 531.1 Gy, with a dose rate of 420.1 cGyhr.
[Patient]: Okay, I remember that treatment. Did it help?
[Doctor]: One year later, you showed some scleral thinning and a prolapse of uveal tissue at the limbus, corresponding to the site of the preexisting lesion. UBM showed a local scleral extension of the tumor under the conjunctival layer, 0.88 mm thick. Your best-corrected visual acuity BCVA was 2020.
[Patient]: So, what was the next step?
[Doctor]: The patient underwent a radical block excision of the sclera, ciliary melanoma, and adjacent iris tissue. This was done by performing a peripheral iridectomy through the opening of the sclera, combined with a corneal tectonic graft, 8.50 mm large. We used 16 single stitches to close the wound.
[Patient]: I remember that surgery. Did it remove the melanoma completely?
[Doctor]: Histological analysis of the removed tissue confirmed the diagnosis of spindle cell melanoma. We will continue to monitor your condition and follow upS: The patient reports experiencing a thickening of the iris in the left eye, which has been bothersome.

[Patient]: Yeah, Ive been feeling really tired and confused lately. I also noticed some unexplained weight loss.
[Doctor]: Your physical exam didnt show any signs of volume overload or depletion, which is good. However, your workup revealed a sodium level of 126 mmoll without other electrolyte abnormalities, serum osmolality of 260 mOsmkg, serum uric acid level of 2.0 mgdl, normal cortisol, normal TSH, urine sodium of 45 mmoll, and urine osmolality of 274 mOsmkg. These findings are consistent with a condition called SIADH. You were taking Citalopram, which we thought might have been the cause, so we stopped it. However, your hyponatremia persisted, so we did some more tests, especially considering your extensive smoking history.
[Patient]: Yeah, Ive been a smoker for a long time.
[Doctor]: We performed a computed tomography CT scan, which showed a right hilar mass with metastasis to the liver, right femur, and ribs. A biopsy revealed that you have small cell lung cancer SCLC.
[Patient]: Oh no, thats terrible.
[Doctor]: I understand this is difficult news, but its important to address it. Ive noticed that youve continued to smoke cigarettes even after the SCLC diagnosis. About two weeks later, you were admitted for acute hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure due to postobstructive pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and secondary pneumothorax. We managed these issues, and there was some improvement in your respiratory status.
[Patient]: Yeah, my breathing got a bit better after that.
[Doctor]: However, your PaCO2 and serum bicarbonate levels began to increase, with the bicarbonate level approaching up to 45 mEqdl. This was associated with refractory hypokalemia and uncontrolled hypertension. We noticed metabolic alkalosis, which was chloride resistant, as your urine chloride was 20 mEqdl. Your hyponatremia responded moderately to fluid restriction and gradually normalized after the onset of metabolic alkalosis.
[Patient]: So, what does that mean for me?
[Doctor]: Well, with uncontrolled hypertensionS: The patient, a long-term smoker, presented with persistent hyponatremia for about a month, accompanied by fatigue, confusion, and unexplained weight loss. The patient has a history of small cell lung cancer SCLC and was admitted for acute hypoxic and hypercapnic respiratory failure due to postobstructive pneumonia, COPD exacerbation, and secondary pneumothorax.
O: Physical examination showed no signs of volume overload or depletion. Laboratory findings included a sodium level of 126 mmolL, serum osmolality of 260 mOsmkg, serum uric acid level of 2.0 mgdl, normal cortisol, normal TSH, urine sodium of 45 mmolL, and urine osmolality of 274 mOsmkg. CT scan revealed a right hilar mass with metastasis to the liver, right femur, and ribs. Biopsy confirmed SCLC. Post-admission, PaCO2 and serum bicarbonate levels increased, leading to refractory hypokalemia and uncontrolled hypertension. Urine chloride was 20 mEqdl, indicating metabolic alkalosis.

"S: The patient reported attending three antenatal visits with routine care and documented fundal height. She experienced occasional painful fetal kicks but was otherwise well during the antenatal period. She noticed reduced fetal movements three days before admission, leading to a diagnosis of fetal demise at a health center.
O: Upon admission, the patients vital signs were stable, with no abdominal tenderness, and a fundal height of 32cm. Fetal parts were not palpable, and no fetal heart tones were detected. There was no per vaginal bleeding, and the cervix was long, posterior, firm, and closed. An emergency ultrasound confirmed fetal demise and showed gross cranial deformation without intra-abdominal location. Intraoperative findings included a third-degree macerated female fetus weighing 2650g with a tight cord around the neck, floating freely in the peritoneal cavity, and a placenta implanted on the ascending colon and mesocolon. Postoperative medications included ampicillin, gentamycin, metronidazole, methotrexate, and folinic acid.
A: The primary diagnosis is fetal demise with complications including gross cranial deformation and abnormal placental implantation. Differential diagnosis could include intra-abdominal pregnancy given the unusual findings, although this was not confirmed. The prognosis is guarded due to the potential for infection and the need for ongoing monitoring of placental site and overall recovery.
P: Management included cervical ripening with misoprostol, followed by operative delivery due to failed induction. Postoperatively, the patient was treated with antibiotics and methotrexate to manage placental implantation and prevent infection. She was discharged on day 8 post-operation with instructions for home recovery and follow-up care. Further consultations with obstetrics and possibly mental health services are recommended to address physical and emotional recovery. Compliance with medication and follow-up appointments is crucial for recovery and monitoring for potential complications.","Summarize the following medical dialogue into a SOAP note:
[Doctor]: Hello, I understand that you were referred to us for management of fetal demise. Can you tell me about your antenatal visits and any symptoms youve experienced during your pregnancy?
[Patient]: Yes, I attended 3 antenatal visits at a health center. They documented my fundal height at each visit and gave me routine care. I had occasional painful fetal kicks, but I was otherwise well throughout the antenatal period.
[Doctor]: Its good that you had regular visits. When did you start to notice reduced fetal movements?
[Patient]: Hmm, about three days before I got admitted to your service, I noticed the reduced movements, so I consulted at the health center, and they said it was fetal demise.
[Doctor]: I see. When you were admitted to our unit, we checked your vital parameters and found them to be stable. There was no abdominal tenderness, and your fundal height was 32cm. Fetal parts were not easily palpable, and we couldnt perceive fetal heart tones. Also, there were no signs of per vaginal bleeding. Your cervix was long, posterior, firm, and closed. We requested an emergency ultrasound scan, which confirmed the fetal demise and showed gross cranial deformation. However, it didnt diagnose an intra-abdominal location.
[Patient]: Thats really sad. So, what did you do next?
[Doctor]: We started cervical ripening with 50g of misoprostol vaginally every 6 hours. After 4 applications, your cervix remained unchanged. So, we decided to proceed with operative delivery to avoid failed induction and reduce the risk of disseminated intravascular coagulation.
[Patient]: What did you find during the operation?
[Doctor]: The intraoperative findings showed a third-degree macerated female fetus floating freely in the peritoneal cavity, weighing 2650g with a tight cord round her neck, and there was no amniotic sac. The uterus was about 14 weeks, and the fallopian tubes and ovaries were normal. The placenta was implanted on the ascending colon and mesocolon. We decided to leave the placenta in place as there were no intraoperative complications encountered.
[Patient]: What treatment did I receive after the operation?
[Doctor]: Postoperatively, you were placed on ampicillin, gentamycin, and metronidazole parenterally for five days to prevent infectionS: The patient was referred for management of fetal demise. She reported attending three antenatal visits at a health center, where her fundal height was documented and routine care was provided.

[Doctor]: Hello, how can I help you today?
[Patient]: Hi, Im here because I fell from a bunk bed nine days ago and I hurt my left wrist. I got it checked at another facility and they put a splint on it, but I wanted a second opinion.
[Doctor]: I see. Do you have a history of any other medical issues or injuries?
[Patient]: Hmm, well, Ive had some issues with intravenous drug abuse and Ive been incarcerated before.
[Doctor]: Thank you for sharing that information. Lets take a look at your wrist. Ill need to remove the splint and take new X-rays to assess the situation.
[Patient]: Sure, go ahead.
Doctor takes X-rays
[Doctor]: Your X-rays show that the fracture is highly comminuted, meaning there are many small, intra-articular fragments. To restore overall radiographic parameters and stability, well use ligamentotaxis with a 2.42.7 mm Synthes dorsal bridge plate. Well also add percutaneously placed K wires for extra stabilization of the radial styloid and lunate facet.
[Patient]: Okay, so what does that involve?
[Doctor]: Well make two incisions, one over the index metacarpal and one over the radial shaft. We wont open the third dorsal extensor compartment at the level of the wrist, which is a contrast to others techniques. The plate will be placed deep to the extensor tendons in the proximal, radial shaft incision. Well leave the K wire ends outside the skin to allow staged hardware removal without multiple trips to the operating room.
[Patient]: Got it. And after the procedure, what will my recovery look like?
[Doctor]: Postoperative X-rays will show improved radial inclination and articular congruity, with some residual slight dorsal tilt. Youll return for regular follow-up visits, and well remove the two K wires in the clinic about 4 weeks after surgery. At that point, you should be able to extend your thumb at the interphalangeal joint.
[Patient]: That sounds good. Is there anything else I should know?
[Doctor]: Plate removal will be discussed during your follow-up visits, but its important to keep attending those appointments. In some cases, patients might experience sensations like clicking with wrist motion or difficulty extending their thumb. If that happens, well need to address it.

[Doctor]: Hello, I see from your history that youre a 33-year-old Japanese woman with a history of IgAN and diabetes mellitus. Youve been admitted to our hospital for the initiation of insulin therapy and evaluation of persistent proteinuria. Is that correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats correct.
[Doctor]: I understand that you had a renal biopsy for proteinuria back in 2009 and were diagnosed with IgAN at our hospital. At your current presentation, you have 0.71.0 gday of urinary protein excretion without significant haematuria. Is that right?
[Patient]: Yes, thats what Ive been told.
[Doctor]: Your mean blood pressure is 11060 mmHg, and youve been treated with an angiotensin receptor blocker ARB for IgAN with persistent proteinuria. Your urinary protein excretion levels have been about 0.5 gday after the initiation of ARB. Two years later, you underwent a tonsillectomy for persistent proteinuria. Is that all correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats correct.
[Doctor]: In 2012, you were diagnosed with diabetes mellitus based on your fasting plasma glucose levels and haemoglobin A1c HbA1c levels during regular visits. You were started on a dipeptidyl peptidase-4 DPP-4 inhibitor and Pioglitazone. However, one year later, you discontinued both the regular visits to our hospital and your medication. What was the reason for that?
[Patient]: I wasnt feeling well, and I thought I could manage it on my own.
[Doctor]: I see. Seven days prior to your admission at our hospital, you visited a clinic for fatigue. Your random blood glucose level was 375 mgdL, and based on this result and persistent proteinuria, you were referred to our hospital. How are you feeling now?
[Patient]: Im still feeling tired and a bit weak.
[Doctor]: Regarding your family history, your younger sister was diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance, and your maternal grandmother was diagnosed with diabetes. Is that correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats right.
[Doctor]: Your physical examination showed that you have a height of 147.0 cm and a weight of 46 kg, with a body mass index BMI of 21.3. We also found several abnormal values in your laboratory testing, including a random blood glucose levelS: The patient is a 33-year-old Japanese woman with a history of IgA nephropathy IgAN and diabetes mellitus, presenting with persistent proteinuria. She reports feeling tired and weak. She has a family history of diabetes, with a sister diagnosed with impaired glucose tolerance and a maternal grandmother with diabetes.
O: Vital signs show a mean blood pressure of 11060 mmHg. Urinary protein excretion is 0.71.0 gday without significant haematuria. Laboratory findings include a random blood glucose level of 375 mgdL, HbA1c of 9.1%, and a serum creatinine level of 0.8 mgdL. Physical examination reveals a BMI of 21.3.
A: The primary diagnosis is IgAN with persistent proteinuria and secondary diabetes mellitus. The patient has a history of non-compliance with prescribed medications, which may contribute to her current health status. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of proteinuria and hyperglycemia, such as other forms of nephropathies or endocrine disorders.
P: Initiate insulin therapy for diabetes and continue ARB for IgAN. Educate the patient on the importance of adherence to medication and regular follow-up appointments."
"S: The patient presented with new-onset diffuse headaches that began several weeks ago following coitus. The headaches were severe, rated 8 out of 10, accompanied by nausea and vomiting. The patient reported that the headaches worsened when upright and did not improve with steroids, caffeine infusion, or hydrocodone-acetaminophen treatment.
O: A fluoroscopic-guided lumbar puncture showed initial CSF pressure of 5 mmHg fluid-coupled and 11.5 cm H2O fluid column, with a final pressure of 2 mmHg fluid-coupled and 3.5 cm H2O fluid column after removing 10 cc of clear CSF. MRI with gadolinium enhancement revealed cerebellar tonsils descending through the foramen magnum, slit ventricles, and dural enhancement. Post-treatment with an epidural injection of whole blood, the patient reported complete resolution of headaches, rating them 0 out of 10, and was able to ambulate without difficulty.
A: The primary diagnosis is a cerebrospinal fluid leak post-coitus, likely exacerbated by intracranial hypotension, as evidenced by imaging findings and symptomatology. Differential diagnoses could include migraine or other secondary headaches, but these are less likely given the imaging results and response to treatment.
P: The patient responded well to the epidural blood patch treatment. The plan is to continue monitoring symptoms and advise the patient to return if headaches recur or new symptoms appear. Further follow-up with neurology might be necessary to manage potential long-term complications related to the cerebellar tonsil descent. Education on recognizing symptoms of CSF leaks and the importance of timely treatment will be provided to ensure prompt action in case of recurrence.","Summarize the following medical dialogue into a SOAP note:

"S: The patient reports experiencing painful right upper thoracic radiculopathy for approximately 18 months, rating the pain as 7-8 out of 10. The pain is partially relieved by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. The patient denies muscle contracture and pain upon palpation. Pain location is described as approximately 3 cm from the thoracic midline on the right side with some intercostal irradiation.
O: Physical examination did not reveal any muscle contracture or tenderness on palpation. Radiographs showed no osteolysis or deformity. MRI findings included a T2 hypersignal and a T1 hyposignal at the medial side of the right T1 vertebra, with inflammation of the right T1 root. Radioisotope bone scanning indicated lateral hyperfixation at the right T1 vertebra. CT scan revealed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of the right T1 pedicle, close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve.
A: The primary diagnosis is osteoid osteoma of the right T1 vertebra, causing radiculopathy and pain due to its proximity to the dura mater and spinal nerve. Differential diagnoses were considered but ruled out based on imaging studies.
P: The management plan includes surgical resection of the osteoid osteoma using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance, specifically using the Surgivisio system for intraoperative navigation. Radiofrequency ablation is contraindicated due to the proximity of the lesion to critical structures. The patient will be positioned prone under general anesthesia, and a mini-open posterior approach at the C7-T2 levels will be performed. Postoperative care will focus on pain management and monitoring for any signs of complications. The patient has been educated about the procedure and expressed comfort with the planned approach. Follow-up appointments will be scheduled to assess recovery and ensure no recurrence.","Summarize the following medical dialogue into a SOAP note:
[Doctor]: Hello, I see youve come in for an outpatient consultation regarding painful right upper thoracic radiculopathy. Can you tell me how long youve been experiencing this pain?
[Patient]: Yeah, Ive been dealing with this pain for about 18 months now. Its been pretty bad.

[Patient]: No, I dont have any contracture, and it doesnt hurt when you press on it.
[Doctor]: Can you show me exactly where the pain is located?
[Patient]: Its about 3 cm from the thoracic midline on the right side, and I feel some intercostal irradiation too.
[Doctor]: Thank you for that information. Based on the radiographs we took, we didnt find any osteolysis or deformity. However, the MRI showed a T2 hypersignal and a T1 hyposignal at the medial side of your right T1 vertebra, along with inflammation of the right T1 root. The radioisotope bone scanning also revealed lateral hyperfixation on the right side of your T1 vertebra.
[Patient]: Oh, I see. What does that mean?
[Doctor]: The CT scan showed an osteolytic lesion surrounded by sclerotic bone at the medial wall of your right T1 pedicle. The lesion is close to the dura mater and T1 spinal nerve, which is causing the inflammation and pain youre experiencing. The aspect of the lesion is compatible with a condition called osteoid osteoma.
[Patient]: What can be done about it?
[Doctor]: Our team recommends a surgical resection using a posterior approach with 3D imaging guidance. Because the lesion is so close to the dura mater, we cannot perform radiofrequency ablation, which would require thermal ablation. The surgery should be safe and complete, with no risk of recurrence. Well also make sure to preserve the vertebral stability without needing screw fixation.

He reports previous treatments including pembrolizumab, ipilimumab, nivolumab, and most recently avelumab combined with radiotherapy. He expresses concerns about his disease progression and treatment options.
O: The patient has undergone various treatments for MCC with varying responses. Initially treated with pembrolizumab, he showed progressive disease. Subsequent treatment with ipilimumab 3 mgkg and nivolumab 1 mgkg every 3 weeks for four cycles resulted in a partial response lasting 30 weeks, followed by disease progression. Re-treatment with the same regimen led to progressive disease at 14 weeks. Most recent treatment with avelumab 10 mgkg every 2 weeks and 3D conformal radiation therapy 2500 centigray to a right iliac mass resulted in a partial response per RECIST v1.1, with marked regression in the irradiated tumor. His ECOG performance status improved from 2 to 0, and the partial response lasted 12 months.
A: The primary diagnosis is metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma with a history of multiple lines of systemic therapy and variable responses. The patients current status post-avelumab and radiotherapy shows a partial response with improved performance status. Given the history of Lynch syndrome, ongoing surveillance for other malignancies is indicated.
P: Continue close monitoring of the patients condition with regular follow-ups to assess the durability of the current response and to detect any new disease progression. Maintain current treatment with avelumab and consider additional radiotherapy for new lesions if indicated. Provide supportive care and manage side effects of therapy.

"S: The patient, a male admitted to Queens Hospital Center, complained of shortness of breath persisting for two days and decreased exercise tolerance over a few weeks. He had a history of chest pain two weeks prior, which was evaluated but did not result in a diagnosis of acute coronary syndrome. The patient was unaware of some of his lab results and treatment details until explained by the physician.
O: Upon evaluation, the patient exhibited tachycardia with a heart rate of 120-124min and blood pressure of 11080 mm Hg. Lungs were clear on auscultation, and there was no sign of infection or blood loss. Initial tests showed elevated creatinine at 1.6, preventing a CT chest, leading to a VQ scan indicating intermediate probability for pulmonary thromboembolism. Lab results also indicated hypocalcemia 6.8-7.9 mgdL, hypokalemia 3.2-3.4 mEQL, low 25-hydroxyvitamin D 6 ngml, and elevated intact parathyroid hormone 85.1 pgml. A subsequent CT chest confirmed old embolism and revealed a 1.1 cm nodule in the left upper lobe. The patient experienced persistent tachycardia, temperature spikes, and ultimately cardiorespiratory failure, leading to intubation and ICU transfer.
A: The primary diagnosis was pulmonary embolism with complications including electrolyte imbalances hypocalcemia, hypokalemia and vitamin D deficiency. Differential diagnosis included secondary hyperparathyroidism. The patients sudden collapse and cardiorespiratory failure were critical developments, leading to his death despite resuscitative efforts.
P: The patient was managed with anticoagulation therapy for pulmonary embolism and metoprolol 50 mg twice daily for tachycardia. Intravenous hydration with electrolyte supplementation was administered to address imbalances. Endocrinology was consulted for the management of persistent tachycardia and potential parathyroid issues. Antibiotics Tamiflu and Rocephin were started due to temperature spikes and pending blood culture results. Despite intensive care and management efforts, the patient did not survive. The family declined an autopsy. Further family support and counseling were offered to address their questions and concerns.","Summarize the following medical dialogue into a SOAP note:
[Doctor]: Hello, I see youve been admitted to Queens Hospital Center with a complaint of shortness of breath for two days duration. Can you tell me more about how youve been feeling lately?
[Patient]: Yeah, Ive been noticing a decrease in my exercise tolerance for a few weeks now. And two weeks ago, I was admitted here for chest pain, but they ruled out acute coronary syndrome.
[Doctor]: I see. Based on your evaluation, you had tachycardia with a heart rate of 120-124min and blood pressure of 11080 mm Hg. Your lungs were clear to auscultation, and there was no evidence of infection or blood loss. We started you on anticoagulation for pulmonary embolism. Do you remember if you had a CT chest done?
[Patient]: No, they didnt do a CT chest initially because my creatinine was elevated at 1.6.
[Doctor]: Right, so instead they did a ventilationperfusion scan, or VQ scan, which showed intermediate probability for pulmonary thromboembolism. We decided to continue your anticoagulation. However, you still had persistent tachycardia, and blood tests showed hypocalcemia at 6.8-7.9 mgdL and hypokalemia at 3.2-3.4 mEQL, but your thyroid function was normal.
[Patient]: Oh, I didnt know that.
[Doctor]: We also found that your 25-hydroxyvitamin D test was low at 6 ngml, and your intact parathyroid hormone was elevated at 85.1 pgml. As a result, we put you on metoprolol 50 mg twice daily and continued intravenous hydration with electrolyte supplementation. We eventually did a CT chest which confirmed the presence of old embolism and showed a 1.1 cm nodule in your left upper lobe.
[Patient]: So, whats the plan now?
[Doctor]: Weve consulted endocrinology for your persistent tachycardia with relatively stable blood pressure. You also had spikes of temperature for two days, so we started you on Tamiflu and Rocephin while waiting for blood culture results.
[Patient]: Okay, I understand. But I really want to be discharged and go home.
[Doctor]: I understand, but we need to monitor your condition closely. Unfortunately, youS: The patient, a middle-aged individual, presented with a chief complaint of shortness of breath for two days duration. The patient reported a decrease in exercise tolerance for several weeks and a previous admission for chest pain, which was ruled out as acute coronary syndrome. The patient expressed a desire to be discharged and return home.
O: On examination, the patient had tachycardia with a heart rate of 120-124min and blood pressure of 11080 mm Hg. Lungs were clear to auscultation, and there was no evidence of infection or blood loss. Initial labs showed elevated creatinine at 1.6 mgdL, hypocalcemia at 6.8-7.9 mgdL, and hypokalemia at 3.2-3.4 mEQL. Thyroid function tests were normal.

The symptoms have persisted for over six months. The patient has a history of hypertension with poor control and has used traditional Chinese medicine for symptom relief. No pathologic findings were reported from a previous colonoscopy.
O: Physical examination revealed mesogastric tenderness and splenomegaly. Laboratory tests showed mild hypokalemia urinary and stool reports were normal. Enhanced CT indicated splenomegaly, jejunal wall edema, narrowed lumen, enlarged lymph nodes, mesenteric edema, atrophy of the right liver lobe, hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, calcification, and periportal fibrosis, suggesting hepatic schistosomiasis. Double balloon enteroscopy was limited due to unstable blood pressure however, upper enteroscopy revealed a significant ulcer in the jejunum and multiple scattered irregular ulcers. Histopathology confirmed chronic jejunal inflammation with ulcerative changes and old S. japonicum eggs deposition.
A: The primary diagnosis is hepatic schistosomiasis with associated chronic jejunal inflammation and ulceration. Differential diagnoses could include other causes of chronic abdominal pain and malabsorption, but imaging and histopathology strongly support schistosomiasis. The prognosis depends on effective management of the infection and associated complications.
P: The patient received symptomatic treatment with intravenous fluids, electrolytes, antispasmodic medication, and proton-pump inhibitors during hospitalization. The patient opted for voluntary discharge and plans to continue treatment and follow-up at a local hospital. It is crucial to maintain consistent follow-up, monitor symptoms, and adhere to prescribed treatments.

[Doctor]: Alright, during your physical examination here, we found mesogastric tenderness and an enlarged spleen. Your blood laboratory examination reported only mild hypokalemia, and your urinary and stool reports were normal. Enhanced computerized tomography showed splenomegaly, jejunal wall edema, narrowed lumen, enlarged lymph nodes, mesenteric edema, atrophy of the right liver lobe, hypertrophy of the left and caudate lobes, calcification, and periportal fibrosis. These signs are compatible with hepatic schistosomiasis.
[Patient]: Oh, that sounds serious.
[Doctor]: Yes, it is a condition that needs attention. During the double balloon enteroscopy, we noticed that your blood pressure was not stable, so we couldnt reexamine the colon. The upper enteroscopy showed an ulcer 150 cm distal to the Treitz ligament, measuring 3.0 x 2.0 cm. The ulcer had a white coating and peripheral mucosal hyperemia, occupying 23 of the lumen, making it difficult for the endoscope to pass through. We took four biopsies from the ulcer, and 20 cm proximal from the ulcer, we found many scattered irregular ulcers, from which we took two biopsies.
[Patient]: What did the histopathological examination reveal?
[Doctor]: The examination reported chronic jejunal inflammation with ulcerative changes and old S. japonicum eggs deposition.

[Doctor]: Hi there, I see youre a 37-year-old female indicated for IVF due to bilateral tubal factors. We initiated the ovulation induction on day 2 of your menstrual cycle. How have you been feeling since then?
[Patient]: Well, I traveled to So Paulo on business with my mother and sister one day after starting the treatment. I took the medications with me, but I noticed some changes in my body.
[Doctor]: Can you tell me more about these changes?
[Patient]: Sure. I returned and underwent an ultrasound on day 5 of the treatment, and I noticed a skin rash on my trunk, spreading to my limbs. My mother and sister reported the same symptoms too.
[Doctor]: I see. Have you experienced any other symptoms, such as fever or pain?
[Patient]: Yes, my temperature was 37C, and I had mild low back pain and insignificant joint pain.
[Doctor]: Thank you for sharing that. We did a complete blood count and it did not show any changes in your platelets and leukocytes. We also performed a blood test for ZIKV using a reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction RT-PCR for both you and your husband.
[Patient]: Thats good to know. Whats next in the treatment?
[Doctor]: We proceeded with the oocyte aspiration at the clinics expense, and we were able to retrieve seven MII stage oocytes. We also collected your follicular fluid and cumulus cells, as well as your husbands semen, for further study.
[Patient]: I see. Is there anything else I need to be aware of?
[Doctor]: This is a single-patient case report at our private IVF center. Our Institutional Review Board IRB does not consider it as human subjects research, so no IRB approval was needed. However, we made sure to get informed written consent from both you and your husband.
[Patient]: Okay, thank you for explaining that. What are the next steps for us?
[Doctor]: We will continue to monitor your progress and keep you informed of any developments. Please continue to take your medications as prescribed and let us know if you experience any further symptoms or side effects.
[Patient]: Alright, thank you for keeping us informed and guiding us through this process.
[Doctor]: Youre welcome. If you have any questions or concerns at any point, please dont hesitate to reach out. Were here to support you and your husband throughoutS: The patient is a 37-year-old female presenting for IVF due to bilateral tubal factors. She reports experiencing a skin rash on her trunk spreading to her limbs, mild low back pain, and insignificant joint pain. Her temperature is 37C. She traveled with her mother and sister, both experiencing the same symptoms.
O: The patient underwent an ultrasound on day 5 of IVF treatment, revealing no changes in platelets or leukocytes. A blood test for ZIKV using RT-PCR was negative. Seven MII stage oocytes were retrieved, and follicular fluid and cumulus cells were collected for further study. The Institutional Review Board IRB did not consider this as human subjects research, and informed consent was obtained from both the patient and her husband.
A: The primary diagnosis is a skin rash associated with IVF treatment, likely an adverse reaction to the medication. Differential diagnoses could include ZIKV infection, but this was ruled out by negative RT-PCR results.

"S: The patient, a known hepatitis B carrier, reports suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma HCC with multiple lung metastases for the past 3 months. He presented with a chief complaint of headache and has developed symptoms of left nasal obstruction, clear rhinorrhea, and left facial pain.
O: A brain MRI indicated a solid mass in the left nasal cavity, measuring 3.7  1.8  2.8 cm with iso-signal intensity on T1, high signal on T2, and heterogeneous enhancement on Gd-T1 weighted images. Small foci of low signal on gradient-echo images suggest hemorrhage. No restricted diffusion was noted on DWI and ADC map. A follow-up CT scan showed rapid growth of the mass to 6.2  2.2  3.4 cm, involving the ostium of the nasolacrimal duct and the lateral wall of the anterior nasal cavity. Histological examination from a punch biopsy confirmed metastatic HCC, grade 2 moderately differentiated.
A: Primary diagnosis is metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma in the nasal cavity, with rapid progression and involvement of critical anatomical structures. Differential diagnosis could include other forms of nasal cavity tumors, but histology confirms metastatic HCC. The prognosis is guarded due to the rapid progression of the tumor and the patients declining general condition.
P: The patient was initially planned for surgical resection of the tumor, but due to deterioration in his general health, he will be transferred to another hospital for further treatment and management. This will likely include palliative care and supportive measures to manage symptoms and improve quality of life. Further oncological consultation and possibly targeted therapy or chemotherapy may be considered based on his overall health status and response to initial treatments at the new facility.","Summarize the following medical dialogue into a SOAP note:
[Doctor]: Hi there, I understand youve been suffering from HCC with multiple lung metastases for the past 3 months. Youre a hepatitis B carrier, correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats right.
[Doctor]: I see that you were admitted complaining of a headache. We performed a brain MRI scan to check for any brain metastasis. The results showed a solid mass occupying your left nasal cavity, measuring 3.7  1.8  2.8 cm.
[Patient]: Oh, that doesnt sound good.
[Doctor]: Yes, the mass showed iso-signal intensity on the T1 weighted image, high signal intensity on the T2 weighted image, and heterogeneous well enhancement on the Gd-T1 weighted image. Gradient-echo images also showed small foci of low signal, suggesting haemorrhage in the mass.
[Patient]: Hmm, what does that mean?
[Doctor]: This means that there might be bleeding within the mass. We didnt find any restricted diffusion in the mass on diffusion-weighted imaging DWI and the apparent diffusion coefficient ADC map. Metastasis of HCC was suggested, as your nasal cavity was normal on a positron emission tomography CT scan that had been performed 3 months ago.
[Patient]: I see. I have developed some symptoms like left nasal obstruction, clear rhinorrhea, and left facial pain.
[Doctor]: Those symptoms are consistent with the mass in your nasal cavity. We performed an excisional biopsy with a CT scan 17 days after the MRI scan. It showed that the mass had rapidly increased in size to 6.2  2.2  3.4 cm, with involvement of the ostium of the nasolacrimal duct and the lateral wall of the anterior nasal cavity.
[Patient]: Wow, thats a big change.
[Doctor]: Yes, it is. There was no calcification in the mass on the pre-contrast CT scan. We conducted a punch biopsy and the histological examination revealed tumor cells with enlarged nucleoli and clear cytoplasm arranged in trabecular cords and glandular arrays, consistent with metastatic HCC.
[Patient]: So, whats the grade of the tumor?
[Doctor]: The tumor is grade 2, which means its moderately differentiated. We were planning for a resection of the tumor, but unfortunately, your general condition has declined.
[Patient]: Oh no, whats going to happenS: The patient, a hepatitis B carrier, has been diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma HCC with multiple lung metastases for the past 3 months. The patient reports symptoms of left nasal obstruction, clear rhinorrhea, and left facial pain.

The plan includes monitoring recovery, adherence to post-surgery care instructions, and regular follow-up to ensure no further complications. The patient is advised to contact healthcare providers if any concerns arise during recovery.","Summarize the following medical dialogue into a SOAP note:
[Doctor]: Hi, Im Dr. Smith, the specialist you were referred to by your primary care physician. Can you tell me about the problem youve been experiencing?
[Patient]: Hello, Dr. Smith. My primary care doctor noticed that my tonsils were enlarged during an examination of my oral cavity. The right one is slightly larger than the left, but there wasnt any surface abnormality.
[Doctor]: I see. And did your doctor prescribe any medication for it?
[Patient]: Yes, they prescribed me two courses of amoxicillin, but it didnt help me improve.
[Doctor]: Alright. Ive reviewed your medical history and it seems to be unremarkable. We also did not find any cervical lymphadenopathy, significant systemic symptoms, malignancy, or immunocompromise. Your laboratory parameters were within normal limits as well.
[Patient]: Thats good to hear.
[Doctor]: We conducted a Magnetic Resonance MR imaging test to look for any mass lesions in your tonsils, but no obvious mass was found. However, the images did show that the right tonsil is larger than the left.
[Patient]: Hmm, okay.
[Doctor]: On the axial T2-weighted image and postgadolinium T1-weighted image with fat saturation, we did not find any mass in the right tonsil. The left tonsil showed mucosal crypts with linear enhancement, but on the right side, the crypts were partly obliterated by a large mass and did not display enhancement.
[Patient]: Oh, I see.
[Doctor]: Due to the possibility of malignancy, we decided to perform a complete surgical resection of the right tonsil.
[Patient]: How did the surgery go?
[Doctor]: The surgery was successful. The histological examination of the specimen revealed diffuse sheets of monomorphous plasmacytoid cells with abundant eosinophilic finely granular cytoplasm and eccentric nuclei. We also observed occasional binucleated and pleomorphic cells with giant nuclei and prominent nucleoli, as well as mitotic figures.
[Patient]: What does that mean?
[Doctor]: These findings indicate that there is no amyloid deposition. Immunohistochemically, the plasma cells were diffusely immunoreactive for  light chain and IgG. This means that the cells are producing a specific type of antibody, but its not a sign of malignancy.
[Patient]: Oh, thats a reliefS: The patient reports that their primary care physician noticed enlarged tonsils during an oral cavity examination, with the right tonsil slightly larger than the left. The patient was prescribed two courses of amoxicillin, which did not improve the condition.

She denies significant alcohol use and has negative viral hepatitis serologies. She reports shortness of breath postoperatively.
O: The patients ferritin level was 319 ngml, anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies were negative, serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, and -1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mgdl. Her BMI is 29.83. Preoperative resting supine oxygen saturation was 93. Postoperatively, she experienced a drop in hemoglobin by two grams, corrected with two units of packed red blood cells. Despite this, she developed hypoxemia with an oxygen saturation of 82 while sitting up and during ambulation, and perioral cyanosis on further ambulation.
A: Primary diagnosis is nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD secondary to type 2 diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia, potentially exacerbated by long-term methotrexate use. Postoperative complications include significant hypoxemia and potential anemia. Differential diagnoses for her respiratory symptoms could include pulmonary embolism, heart failure, or pneumonia.
P: Continue close monitoring of the patients respiratory status and hemoglobin levels. Consider further diagnostic workup for postoperative respiratory distress, including chest X-ray and possibly a CT pulmonary angiogram to rule out pulmonary embolism.

You were admitted to the obstetrics and gynecology service for a planned transvaginal hysterectomy. Can you tell me more about your medical history and any current symptoms youre experiencing?
[Patient]: Hi, Doctor. I dont have any history of significant alcohol use, and my viral hepatitis serologies were negative for hepatitis A, B, and C.
[Doctor]: I noticed that your ferritin level was 319 ngml, which makes hemochromatosis unlikely. Your anti-mitochondrial and anti-smooth muscle cell antibodies were also negative. So, primary biliary cirrhosis and primary sclerosing cholangitis are unlikely in the absence of other clinical findings. We also considered Wilsons disease, but your serum copper and ceruloplasmin levels were normal, and you did not have any psychiatric symptoms.
[Patient]: Yeah, thats right. I also remember that my -1 antitrypsin was within normal limits at 193 mgdl.
[Doctor]: Based on your medical history, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease NAFLD seems to be the most probable explanation for your cirrhosis, given that you have type 2 diabetes mellitus, a body mass index BMI of 29.83, and hyperlipidemia. However, youve been taking methotrexate for more than 10 years for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis, which could also be a contributing factor.
[Patient]: Hmm, I see. So what happened during my preoperative evaluation?
[Doctor]: During the evaluation, your resting supine oxygen saturation was noted to be 93. At that time, you denied any respiratory or cardiac symptoms, so you underwent the transvaginal hysterectomy, which went smoothly with no complications.
[Patient]: Thats good to hear. But I remember feeling short of breath after the surgery.

Intraoperatively, you had brief episodes of hypotension on induction, requiring 3 pressors.
[Patient]: Oh, I didnt know that.
[Doctor]: For the duration of the case, you required intermittent pressure support with a total of phenylephrine 360 mcg, epinephrine 30 mcg, and norepinephrine 36 mcg. After the surgery, you were extubated and transferred to the recovery room in stable condition.
[Patient]: Thats good to hear.
[Doctor]: Your medications postoperatively included celecoxib 200 mg BID and aspirin 325 mg BID, and we continued you on lansoprazole. We also started you on vancomycin 2 g IV every 12 hours and piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375 g IV every 6 hours.
[Patient]: Okay, got it.
[Doctor]: The cultures revealed that your joint was infected with Corynebacterium striatum, so we discontinued the IV piperacillin-tazobactam.
[Patient]: I see.
[Doctor]: On postS: The patient, with a history of diabetes, obstructive sleep apnea, congestive heart failure, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, presented with a history of multiple periprosthetic infections in the left knee.

"S: The patient was admitted after experiencing a sudden thunderclap headache and acute loss of consciousness. The patient denies any past history of hypertension, seizures, drug abuse, trauma, or infection.
O: On admission, the patient was unconscious with a Glasgow Coma Scale GCS score of 1015, indicating a Hunt  Hess classification Grade IV. Initial CT scan revealed diffuse subarachnoid hemorrhage and a cisternal clot at the interpeduncular cistern, classified as Modified Fisher I, with moderate dilatation of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricle. Angiography showed a ruptured saccular aneurysm of less than 3 mm in diameter at the origin of the left frontopolar artery. A second CT scan after a rebleed showed a superior interhemispheric frontal hematoma opening to the ventricular system, classified as Modified Fisher IV. A follow-up magnetic resonant angiogram 6 months post-coil embolization showed stable occlusion. A recent CT scan indicated a chronic infarct in the left frontal lobe.
A: The primary diagnosis is a ruptured saccular aneurysm of the left frontopolar artery with subsequent subarachnoid hemorrhage and chronic infarct in the left frontal lobe. Differential diagnoses initially included other causes of sudden loss of consciousness and headache, but imaging confirmed the aneurysm and associated complications.
P: The patient underwent successful coil embolization of the aneurysm. Ongoing management includes monitoring neurological status, managing potential complications from the chronic infarct, and addressing any new symptoms such as seizures. Regular follow-up with neurology is recommended to assess the stability of the aneurysm occlusion and manage any long-term neurological effects. Education on recognizing symptoms of potential complications and when to seek immediate care is crucial for the patient.","Summarize the following medical dialogue into a SOAP note:
[Doctor]: Hi, I see that you were admitted after experiencing a sudden thunderclap headache, preceded by an acute loss of consciousness at your home. Is that correct?
[Patient]: Yes, thats right. It happened so suddenly.
[Doctor]: I understand. Were there any past history of hypertension, seizures, drug abuse, trauma, or infection before this incident?
[Patient]: No, I never had any of those issues.
[Doctor]: Okay. On admission, our initial clinical examination showed you were unconscious with a GCS score of 1015, which corresponds to Hunt  Hess classification Grade IV.
[Patient]: Oh, that sounds serious.
[Doctor]: After we stabilized you, we performed a CT scan, which showed diffuse subarachnoid haemorrhage and a cisternal clot at the interpeduncular cistern. This is classified as Modified Fisher I. We also noticed moderate dilatation of the temporal horns of the lateral ventricle.
[Patient]: What does that mean, exactly?
[Doctor]: It means that you had bleeding in the space around your brain and a clot formed in a specific area. The dilatation of the temporal horns indicates some swelling in your brain. We then performed an angiography to further investigate the cause.
[Patient]: And what did the angiography show?
[Doctor]: The angiography revealed a ruptured saccular aneurysm of less than 3 mm in diameter, with a neck of 1.5 mm at the origin of your left frontopolar artery. Considering the small size of the aneurysm and its ruptured nature, we decided to manage it conservatively.
[Patient]: I see. But I heard that it bled again after 2 weeks?
[Doctor]: Yes, unfortunately, the aneurysm bled once more. We obtained another CT scan, which showed a superior interhemispheric frontal haematoma that had opened to your ventricular system. This was classified as Modified Fisher IV.
[Patient]: What did you do then?
[Doctor]: On Day 15 after the second haemorrhage, we performed a coiling procedure. After selectively placing a microcatheter in the left frontopolar artery aneurysm, we completely obliterated it with a single coil, maintaining the distal arterial lumen totally permeable.
[Patient]: Did the procedure work?
[Doctor]: Yes,S: The patient presented with a sudden onset of a thunderclap headache, followed by an acute loss of consciousness at home. The patient denied any history of hypertension, seizures, drug abuse, trauma, or infection prior to the incident.

[Patient]: Yes, Ive been experiencing these swellings on both sides of my neck, and theyve been very itchy. My right shoulder has been hurting a lot too.
[Doctor]: Alright, we performed an ultrasound imaging and found pathological bilateral supraclavicular enlarged lymph nodes. After a biopsy, we diagnosed you with nodular sclerosis Hodgkins lymphoma HL.
[Patient]: Oh, that sounds serious.
[Doctor]: It is a type of cancer, but dont worry. We will do our best to help you. We also performed a fetal ultrasound screening and it showed that your baby is developing normally.
[Patient]: Thats a relief. Whats the plan for my treatment?
[Doctor]: We decided not to perform a combined fludeoxyglucose positron emission tomography FDG-PETCT scan before delivery due to the risk of radiation exposure during pregnancy. Instead, we used ultrasound and whole-body MRI WB-MRI to stage the disease. It showed right cervical, bilateral supraclavicular, and mediastinal lymph node involvement without a bulky mass, indicating Stage IIA disease according to Ann Arbor classification.
[Patient]: What does that mean?
[Doctor]: It means the cancer is in the early stages and has not spread extensively. The multidisciplinary team, including haematologists, gynaecologists, radiologists, and neonatologists, decided to start chemotherapy only if clinically necessary. We have been following up with ultrasound, WB-MRI, haematology consults, and gynaecological examinations. We also started therapy with steroid and paracetamol to slow down the progression of the disease and treat your itching and shoulder pain.
[Patient]: Hmm, okay. And hows my condition now?
[Doctor]: At pregnancy week 27, WB-MRI demonstrated a slight progression of the disease, seen as an enlargement of the lymph node packages, with the largest in the mediastinum having an axial diameter of 5.4 x 4.5 cm.

[Doctor]: Hello, I see youve presented with a one-month history of epigastric discomfort. Can you tell me more about your symptoms?
[Patient]: Yeah, Ive been having this discomfort in my upper stomach area for the past month. Its been quite bothersome.
[Doctor]: I understand. We performed a physical examination, and it was unremarkable. However, your laboratory examination showed slightly elevated amylase levels. We conducted an abdominal contrast-enhanced computed tomography CT and found a low-density mass with a diameter of 30 mm at the pancreatic head, with segmental superior mesenteric vein SMV attachment. There was neither stenosis nor arteriosclerosis around the celiac axis at that time.
[Patient]: Oh, that doesnt sound good.
[Doctor]: We also performed endoscopic ultrasonography, and a fine-needle biopsy sample showed adenocarcinoma of the pancreas.
[Patient]: So, its cancer?
[Doctor]: Yes, unfortunately. We proceeded with pancreaticoduodenectomy PD with superior mesenteric vein resection and reconstruction. Additionally, a lymphadenectomy including right half dissection of the lymph nodes was performed without the nerve plexus around the celiac trunk. Intraoperative exploration ruled out latent peritoneal or liver metastasis and showed normal anatomy of the celiac trunk, mesenteric vessels, and related branches.
[Patient]: How did the surgery go?
[Doctor]: The duration of the surgery was 549 minutes, and the blood loss was 863 mL. Blood transfusion was not performed. We had to mobilize the pancreatic body more than usual for the pancreaticojejunostomy because it was a hard pancreas.
[Patient]: What happened after the surgery?
[Doctor]: On postoperative day 3, your liver function tests were still abnormal, and we found bloody fluids in the drain. An abdominal CT showed a characteristic hook-pattern on the anterior proximal celiac axis from compression of the MAL, which had not been detected in the preoperative CT. Ischemic changes in the remnant pancreas, hepatic lateral segment, and gastrojejunostomy site were also observed.
[Patient]: Oh no, what does that mean?
[Doctor]: Although all celiac branches were visible, there were almost no pulsations in those branches. We first tried interventional radiology, but the procedure failed due to tight compression against the outside of the cS: The patient presented with a one-month history of epigastric discomfort.

After running tests
[Doctor]: Your physical examination was unremarkable. Urinalysis revealed a specific gravity of 1.006, a pH of 6.0, but no hematuria or proteinuria. Blood tests showed a lithium level of 1.4 mmolL, a TSH of 5.09 uIUmL normal 0.554.78 uIUmL, a calcium of 11.1 mgdL normal 8.610.6 mgdL, and a creatinine of 1.15 mgdL.
[Patient]: Is there anything we should do about it?
[Doctor]: Your primary care physician PCP reduced your lithium dose to 450 mg twice daily and initiated levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. One week later, your lithium level reduced to 1.1 mmolL. However, over the next couple of weeks, your creatinine increased to 1.3 mgdL.
[Patient]: Oh, that doesnt sound good.
[Doctor]: Your PCP decided to discontinue the lithium by tapering the dose over theS: The patient, with a history of multiple psychiatric conditions including bipolar disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, oppositional defiant disorder, posttraumatic stress disorder, and poor impulse control, presents with urinary frequency and nocturia for about a month. The patient is currently taking clonidine 0.1 mg three times daily, guanfacine 4 mg daily, bupropion sustained-release 150 mg daily, quetiapine 200 mg twice daily, and lithium 450 mg three times daily, started at age 5.
O: Physical examination was unremarkable. Urinalysis showed specific gravity of 1.006, pH of 6.0, and no hematuria or proteinuria. Blood tests revealed a lithium level of 1.4 mmolL, TSH of 5.09 uIUmL, calcium of 11.1 mgdL, and creatinine of 1.15 mgdL. Lithium level decreased to 1.1 mmolL after reducing the dose to 450 mg twice daily and initiating levothyroxine for hypothyroidism. Creatinine increased to 1.3 mgdL over the next couple of weeks.
